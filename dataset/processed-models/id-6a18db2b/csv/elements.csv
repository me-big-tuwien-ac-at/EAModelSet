It may be used as a first step towards an IT organization operating as an autonomous business. It may also be used to encourage users to move in a strategically important direction - for example by subsidizing newer systems and imposing additional charges for the use of legacy systems. Transparency of charging will encourage users to avoid expensive activities where slightly more inconvenient but far cheaper alternatives are available. For example, a user might browse a dump on screen rather than printing it off.

Charging is arguably the most complex of the three sub-processes, requiring a large investment of resources and a high degree of care to avoid anomalies, where an individual department may benefit from behavior which is detrimental to the company as a whole. Charging policy needs to be simultaneously simple, fair and realistic.

Charging need not necessarily mean money changing hands (full charging). It may take the form of information passed to management on the cost of provision of IT services (no charging), or may detail what would be charged if full charging were in place without transactions actually being applied to the financial ledgers (notional charging). Notional charging may also be used as a way of piloting full charging.

It makes a difference whether the organization is an internal service provider, or if it serves external customer as its main business. In the case where an IT organization is an internal service provider (according to ITIL, these are Type I and Type II organizations), it is not necessary to bill for services. Sometimes such IT organizations only allocate costs. If an IT organization sells its services to external customers (Type III organization) they will, certainly, issue bills for their services and generate income which funds that organization.

Charging for services by an organization with external customers is the only way to get funding for the organization, cover costs and generate revenue. But, in the case of an internal service provider it can be seen as bureaucratic procedure, which is true. On the other side, I found that internal charging has several advantages:

It justifies IT resources needed (increased transparency),
users throughout organization use only resources they really need (optimization of usage),
business can plan their cost of operation (which is, further on, included in price charged to their customers), and

2.4.1 Process Overview
The Financial Management process provides the business and IT with the quantification (in financial terms) of the value of IT services, the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services, and the qualification of operational forecasting. It includes all function and processes responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging policies and activities.
Key objectives of Financial Management are:
• Establishing and enforcing IT financial controls
• Ensuring compliance with legal, industry, and corporate standards and procedures
Assisting IT portfolio investment decisions by providing detailed business cases as well as financial input for decision support
• Effectively predicting and controlling IT budgets
• Providing the enterprise with operational visibility, insight, and superior decision-making.
The overriding goal of Financial Management is to provide cost effective stewardship of the IT assets and the financial resources used in providing IT services. Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organization’s customers.
This is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:
• Hardware and software license costs
• Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software
• Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service
• Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges
• Taxes, capital or interest charges
• Compliance costs
• Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes.",""

Purpose
•  Provide chargeback or showback for internal and external services taking into account service Subscription and Usage information.
•  Break down chargeback or showback based on charge types such as CapEx/OpEx, direct/indirect, fixed/variable, and labor/non-labor, as well as by consumer or consumer groups.
•  Charge for IT services rendered based on the pricing model associated with the catalog item, this may also be implemented via showback (no actual billing or cross-charging), which helps the consumer become more IT cost-aware.
•  Trace chargeback or showback line items to individual cost drivers based on the cost model.
•  Consolidate IT service Subscription (right to use) and actual Usage as the usage may differ from the right to use.

The Chargeback/Showback functional component:
•  Shall provide the price of consuming/subscribing to a service.
•  Can take actual usage into consideration when calculating the price of consuming a service.
If an IT Financial Management component exists, the Chargeback/Showback functional component:
•  Can provide the necessary information in order for the IT Financial Management supporting function to produce invoices or bills for services rendered.",""

Budget plans are associated with a budget key and a fiscal period. If you have financial data over several financial periods, make a separate plan for each period.

There are several types of items you can add to the budget plan. The costs of these items are broken down over the fiscal period that you specify for the plan. See Budget items and Budget item breakdowns for more information.

Budget plan expense amount types

Budget plans show these types of expense amounts:

Target amounts: An amount that you set as a goal to reach or a limit not to exceed. A target amount is created for a specific fiscal period and account code combination. When you select the account code and fiscal period for the budget plan, the target amount is automatically populated in the read-only target fields. There are targets for both operating and capital expenses.
Budgeted amounts: A rollup of all the budget plan items, which appear as related lists on the Budget Plan form. Only items marked as capital expenses do not roll up to the amount fields. There are budgeted amounts for both operating and capital expenses.
Budget plan ownership

Budget plans have a single owner, who must have the budget_owner role. Whoever you chose as the budget owner must also be associated with the budget plan's budget key as an owner.

Budget plan parent-child relationships

Budget plans can have one or more sub-plans, which roll up their actual budget amounts to the parent budget plan. You cannot promote child plans individually. Only the top-level plan in a hierarchy can be promoted.

The same account codes can be used for parent and any or all child plans, if necessary. Child plans can also have account codes that are lower in the hierarchy. For example, if the parent's account code is IT finance, the child plan's account code could be IT finance > Auditing Service, or similar. If you have multiple sub-plans with the same account codes, the amounts roll up from all subplans to the forecast.

Changing the fiscal period parent plan cascades the change down to all sub-plans. See Budget owners and budget key owners for more information.

Budget plan promotion

You can promote a budget plan to a budget forecast, based on the plan's account code and fiscal period. The forecast helps you predict the expenses your organization will incur. See Budget forecasts for more information.

Create a budget plan
After you have configured your budget target and account codes, create a budget plan.

Copy a budget plan
You can use any plan as a basis for creating a new plan.

Budget items
The items that comprise a budget plan come from several other applications in an instance, including Asset Management, Project Management, and Configuration Management. This enables you to budget your expenses for items across your IT infrastructure.",""
