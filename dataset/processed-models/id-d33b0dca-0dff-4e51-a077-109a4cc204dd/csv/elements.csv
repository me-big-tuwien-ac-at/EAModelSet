The major components needing to be coordinated for any given flight include the aircraft and support equipment, cockpit and cabin crews (together known as the “flight crew”), maintenance, and ground service personnel. Although the maintenance and ground crew activities are critical to support flight operations, the emphasis in this sub domain is on the regulation and scheduling of the flight crews to conduct a given flight.
In many cases, crewmembers may have never worked together prior to a particular flight. In order to maintain a safe, smoothly functioning and efficient operation, airlines and regulators have developed very detailed procedures to be executed by crewmembers that leave very little room for improvisation. These procedures, including normal, abnormal, and emergency conditions, are detailed in the crewmember’s operating manuals and backed up through a system of checklists which are cross-checked between flight crewmembers. It is the responsibility of the training or flight standards department to establish crewmember proficiency and currency. The Captain, however, is always ultimately responsible for the safe and efficient conduct of the flight and in extraordinary circumstances may deviate from a procedure or regulation under his or her command authority (Captain’s Emergency Authority).
The cabin crew is primarily responsible for passenger safety during the flight. Other duties include providing customer service products (meals, entertainment, etc.) and assistance with boarding. Flight attendants receive specialized training in aircraft emergencies, evacuation procedures, medical issues and health hazards, care of special needs passengers, flight regulations and meal service.
Activities before take-off include flight planning, passenger processing, aircraft preflight, fueling, and other required ground processes. The preflight activities are orchestrated so as to achieve an “on-schedule” pushback from the departure gate, although any maintenance and gate hold issues must also be considered.
While taxiing to the departure runway, the cockpit crew prepares the aircraft for take-off and updates the take-off performance parameters with actual load data. In addition, any departure delays, aircraft icing, and environmental conditions such as runway contamination may need to be addressed.
The take-off is a highly critical maneuver where a number of factors must be taken into consideration including airport/runway, environmental, and emergency/abnormal contingencies. Departure from the terminal area, which may include route and speed restrictions, is followed by the climb to cruise altitude. The optimum cruise altitude is determined by a number of factors including efficiency, ride comfort, other traffic and/or airspace limitations. During cruise flight, the cockpit crew must continually evaluate contingency options in the event of a passenger or mechanical disruption. In addition, some flight situations require adherence to specialized procedures including international routing, mountainous terrain, and extended overwater operations.
During descent, the crew begins preparing the cockpit and cabin for landing. In addition to conforming to ATC (Air Traffic Control) restrictions, the cockpit crew plans the approach to landing which includes consideration of the destination weather, the approach procedures available, and the equipment available on the aircraft to safely and legally complete the arrival. Factors include environmental conditions (visibility, presence of convective weather, runway conditions, etc.), availability of approach aids, aircraft mechanical condition and, if necessary, available fuel for holding. In the event of an unsuccessful approach, diversion to a more suitable landing point may have to be considered.
After landing, the aircraft is taxied to the arrival gate while the crew readies the cockpit and cabin for parking. Once the aircraft is parked, passenger disembarkation is completed as well as baggage/cargo unloading. The flight crews proceed to the next departure gate, or to the ground transportation area if their duty day is complete.
The following tasks are within the scope of this sub domain. It is responsible for Cockpit and Cabin onboard flight preparation, flight operation and Cockpit and Cabin Onboard Communication. It also does the Signature of the Load Sheet by the Captain. Lastly, it manages Onboard Flight Reporting and Onboard Passenger support",""

These procedures, including normal, abnormal, and emergency conditions, are detailed in the crewmember’s operating manuals and backed up through a system of checklists which are cross-checked between flight crewmembers. It is the responsibility of the training or flight standards department to establish crewmember proficiency and currency. The Captain, however, is always ultimately responsible for the safe and efficient conduct of the flight and in extraordinary circumstances may deviate from a procedure or regulation under his or her command authority (Captain’s Emergency Authority).
The cabin crew is primarily responsible for passenger safety during the flight. Other duties include providing customer service products (meals, entertainment, etc.) and assistance with boarding. Flight attendants receive specialized training in aircraft emergencies, evacuation procedures, medical issues and health hazards, care of special needs passengers, flight regulations and meal service.
Activities before take-off include flight planning, passenger processing, aircraft preflight, fueling, and other required ground processes. The preflight activities are orchestrated so as to achieve an “on-schedule” pushback from the departure gate, although any maintenance and gate hold issues must also be considered.
While taxiing to the departure runway, the cockpit crew prepares the aircraft for take-off and updates the take-off performance parameters with actual load data. In addition, any departure delays, aircraft icing, and environmental conditions such as runway contamination may need to be addressed.
The take-off is a highly critical maneuver where a number of factors must be taken into consideration including airport/runway, environmental, and emergency/abnormal contingencies. Departure from the terminal area, which may include route and speed restrictions, is followed by the climb to cruise altitude. The optimum cruise altitude is determined by a number of factors including efficiency, ride comfort, other traffic and/or airspace limitations. During cruise flight, the cockpit crew must continually evaluate contingency options in the event of a passenger or mechanical disruption. In addition, some flight situations require adherence to specialized procedures including international routing, mountainous terrain, and extended overwater operations.
During descent, the crew begins preparing the cockpit and cabin for landing. In addition to conforming to ATC (Air Traffic Control) restrictions, the cockpit crew plans the approach to landing which includes consideration of the destination weather, the approach procedures available, and the equipment available on the aircraft to safely and legally complete the arrival. Factors include environmental conditions (visibility, presence of convective weather, runway conditions, etc.), availability of approach aids, aircraft mechanical condition and, if necessary, available fuel for holding. In the event of an unsuccessful approach, diversion to a more suitable landing point may have to be considered.
After landing, the aircraft is taxied to the arrival gate while the crew readies the cockpit and cabin for parking. Once the aircraft is parked, passenger disembarkation is completed as well as baggage/cargo unloading. The flight crews proceed to the next departure gate, or to the ground transportation area if their duty day is complete.
The following tasks are within the scope of this sub domain. It is responsible for Cockpit and Cabin onboard flight preparation, flight operation and Cockpit and Cabin Onboard Communication.

Ensuring that the aircraft and the pilot are in the right place at the right time, both currently qualified and serviceable, is what an operations manager does. Multiply that by the number of flights per day, and that’s what the operations control department does – it keeps the airline working from moment to moment despite disruption by weather and a thousand other possible occurrences or mishaps.
Take so-called low cost carriers as (somewhat) simple examples. They can be big (300+ aircraft), but are designed for engineering and operations simplicity. They always aim to run single-type fleets with the cabin configuration completely standardized, so any aircraft in the fleet can perform any route, and all flight and cabin crew are type-rated on every aircraft. They are mainly short-haul, and if there are no mishaps every crew finishes each day going home rather than to a hotel. The ops departments can be rather small.
On the other hand, the ops staff at a big intercontinental carrier faces a far more complex task. For example, big carriers have to deal with a lot of aircraft with various different basic types, both short and long haul, and within those type groups there are multiple cabin configurations and – sometimes – different engine fits. Just because a route is normally served by a Boeing 777, if the scheduled one falls out, the ops department has to ensure that a schedule on which First Class tickets are sold is matched with a four-class configured 777 rather than a three-class version.
Operations control solves problems. It matches the airline’s assets – human and hardware, to the promised schedule, come what may. It takes just the smallest twitch of the weather somewhere in the world, or pilots and cabin crew reporting sick, or an unexpected component failure on an aircraft, for the carefully choreographed system to start tumbling unless a way can be found to arrest it.
It’s like juggling, but instead of balls, clubs, rings etc, the props are aircrafts with their maintenance schedules, pilots with their rosters, duty time limitations and recurrent training requirements, cabin crew likewise, airports with curfews, notams and changing weather forecasts, down-route accommodation for crew, passenger management – especially in the case of delay or cancellation, onboard medical emergencies, cargo management, aircraft weight and balance, dispatch coordination, and diversions. 
Big, intercontinental carriers have to manage thousands of departures a day around the globe, carrying hundreds of thousands of passengers.

By varying the route (i.e., ground track), altitudes, speeds, and amount of departure fuel, an effective flight plan can reduce fuel costs, time-based costs, overflight costs (to obtain the right to fly over a country’s airspace), and lost revenue from payload that can't be carried. These variations are subject to airplane performance, weather, allowed route and altitude structure, schedule constraints, and operational constraints.
Ensuring that the aircraft and the pilot are in the right place at the right time, both currently qualified and serviceable, is what an operations manager does. Multiply that by the number of flights per day, and that’s what the operations control department does – it keeps the airline working from moment to moment despite disruption by weather and a thousand other possible occurrences or mishaps.
Take so-called low cost carriers as (somewhat) simple examples. They can be big (300+ aircraft), but are designed for engineering and operations simplicity. They always aim to run single-type fleets with the cabin configuration completely standardized, so any aircraft in the fleet can perform any route, and all flight and cabin crew are type-rated on every aircraft. They are mainly short-haul, and if there are no mishaps every crew finishes each day going home rather than to a hotel. The ops departments can be rather small.
On the other hand, the ops staff at a big intercontinental carrier faces a far more complex task. For example, big carriers have to deal with a lot of aircraft with various different basic types, both short and long haul, and within those type groups there are multiple cabin configurations and – sometimes – different engine fits. Just because a route is normally served by a Boeing 777, if the scheduled one falls out, the ops department has to ensure that a schedule on which First Class tickets are sold is matched with a four-class configured 777 rather than a three-class version.
Operations control solves problems. It matches the airline’s assets – human and hardware, to the promised schedule, come what may. It takes just the smallest twitch of the weather somewhere in the world, or pilots and cabin crew reporting sick, or an unexpected component failure on an aircraft, for the carefully choreographed system to start tumbling unless a way can be found to arrest it.
It’s like juggling, but instead of balls, clubs, rings etc, the props are aircrafts with their maintenance schedules, pilots with their rosters, duty time limitations and recurrent training requirements, cabin crew likewise, airports with curfews, notams and changing weather forecasts, down-route accommodation for crew, passenger management – especially in the case of delay or cancellation, onboard medical emergencies, cargo management, aircraft weight and balance, dispatch coordination, and diversions. 
Big, intercontinental carriers have to manage thousands of departures a day around the globe, carrying hundreds of thousands of passengers. It doesn’t require a lot of imagination to understand that every decision, action or inaction of the operations control department has a serious impact on the overall performance of an airline.
In summary, the following tasks are within the scope of this Capability (Group). It is responsible for calculating operational flight plan (flight path) under consideration of slots, info by ATC, Over-flight rights, Weather, Costs, Flight time. Furthermore it announces operational Flight Plan to ATC and computes payload and minimum fuel. It also provides flight and navigation information to pilots. It prepares and provides briefing documents to crew. It monitors flight plan, identify and evaluate irregularities, i.e. delays caused by ATC or weather. Furthermore it handles irregularities keeping schedule deviation impact and costs as little as possible and interferes with flight plan to minimize disruptions (aircraft change, crew recovery). It is responsible for optimizing the fuel usage and coordinating ATC-slots with Eurocontrol. Lastly, it plans emergency response and does the Flight Dispatch and Crew dispatch.",""

At some point during the climb, the cockpit crew checks the FMS and/or performance charts to compare the optimal and maximum cruise altitudes with the planned data and desired cruise Mach. This information is used to coordinate an optimal cruise altitude with ATC. Other factors include wind data and ride (turbulence) conditions, en-route convective weather, MEL contingencies, traffic-induced speed restrictions and fuel consumption issues. Winds aloft notwithstanding, in most cases higher altitudes provide for more efficient engine operation. If the flight is restricted to a lower altitude due to weather or traffic, the crew must consider the effects on total fuel burn and reserves. In addition, some aircraft types are more fuel sensitive to off-optimal cruise Mach than others, which may also limit the cruise altitude options.
Passenger-related activities during the climb include beginning the meal and/or beverage service, delivering any marketing PA announcements and activating any entertainment systems. In addition, the Captain usually makes a PA describing en-route flight time and weather conditions, points of interest, arrival estimate, destination weather and, if applicable, any information concerning the presence of an augmented crew. Seat belt sign usage is at the Captain’s discretion and is typically activated in the presence of adverse ride conditions, or at the flight attendants’ request such as during the meal service. The segment of the Captain’s PA which informs the passengers that “while in their seats they are to keep their seatbelts fastened” is included by many airlines as a standard procedure and a mandatory disclaimer.",""

"id-6bebc637-eb03-4043-ba83-3781315d1fbe","BusinessProcess","Cruise","As cruise altitude is reached, the power settings/Mach target are established, and the crews will report level to ATC. The crew also performs various administrative duties, including downlinking any departure delay ACARS codes and recording the engine monitor log (if not automated).
During cruise, the crew must maintain a time/fuel log in order to compare planned time and fuel burn performance with the actual time of arrival (ATA) and fuel on board (FOB) over each flight plan waypoint. The baseline departure time and take-off FOB is used to generate the ETA/EFOB (Estimated Time of Arrival/Estimated Fuel On Board) log which is usually very accurate. Consideration must be given by the cockpit crew to the possible causes of any deviations from the waypoint ETAs/EFOBs (including fuel imbalance) and the effect on the destination arrival time and fuel. Potential sources of time/burn variation include winds aloft greater or less than forecast, cruise speed or altitude different than planned or mechanical problems such as a fuel leak. The cockpit crew also continuously evaluates altitude options. As the aircraft weight decreases due to fuel burn, the optimum cruise altitude typically increases due to better engine efficiency at higher altitudes. Available altitude options may be limited by ATC.
On international flights, transitioning through airspace boundaries under the jurisdiction of other national sovereignties may require supplementary procedures to address local restrictions. These FIR (Flight Information Region) boundaries normally require advance notification via the flight planning process (filed flight plan), and preliminary contact by the aircraft as the flight approaches the boundary. Generally, separate ATC clearances must be issued at each boundary crossing, including entering the oceanic airspace. Before entering such airspace, it is the responsibility of the crew to familiarize themselves with any specific procedural requirements including position reporting, use of datalink, radio communications, and any other airspeed or operational limitations (holding speeds, speed limit below a given altitude, etc.).
The need to deviate from the desired track due to adverse weather is always a possibility. The nature of hazardous weather en-route varies with the geographical region (e.g. transcontinental, Caribbean, North Atlantic, etc.) as well as the type of aircraft and the equipment on board. The procedures and available options for coping with adverse weather is also airspace-dependent.
As in other phases of flight, the crew must be constantly prepared for the possibility of contingencies requiring diversion of the aircraft to an en-route alternate airport. In addition to the possible closure of the destination airport (due to weather, power outages, or other field situations), reasons for diverting include medical emergencies (sick passengers/crew), aircraft equipment problems, terrorist activities inflight, unacceptable holding times, fuel diversion due to wind or traffic delays. The decision to divert usually includes input from dispatch and must include a clearance from the controller – unless the Captain declares an emergency. If the situation warrants the declaration of an emergency, the flight is given priority handling en-route, and the necessary ground and rescue services are assembled to meet the aircraft upon arrival.",""

"id-57d46bbd-8a65-40ed-a2dd-ff3004eeff8f","BusinessProcess","Descent","The descent profile is determined by both ATC limitations and optimal aircraft performance. An aircraft operating at typical cruise altitudes (31,000 to 41,000 feet) will nominally initiate the descent at 100 to 130 nautical miles from the destination airport. The distance varies primarily due to ATC restrictions/procedures but also may be influenced by equipment type and environmental conditions such as winds aloft and turbulence. The initial descent takes place with about 30 to 40 minutes remaining in the flight, at which time the crew begins their approach and landing preparations. An “In Range” message is often transmitted to the destination station either through ACARS or by VHF radio. This message includes the latest touchdown estimate, special passenger requests (wheelchairs/connections), and if not already transmitted, any maintenance discrepancies. The station transmits or uplinks the arrival gate assignment, ground power unit status and any other relevant status message such as a “tow-in only” requirement for the assigned gate.
During the descent, ATC may issue crossing restrictions which can be part of a published standard arrival procedure or as a response to a traffic sequencing requirement. If the clearance is not issued as an immediate descent, it is the responsibility of the cockpit crew to determine a top-of-descent (TOD) point which satisfies the crossing restriction.
Ride conditions notwithstanding, it is desirable from an efficiency standpoint to delay the descent as long as possible, then descend at or near engine idle at an optimum speed and meet the restriction within a few miles before the fix to give a margin to ensure the restriction is met. Factors which must be taken into consideration during descent planning include wind direction and intensity for the relevant altitudes, possibility of speed restrictions if not already assigned, high barometric local pressure at the transition level and turbulence.
The FMS is the primary resource available to the crew for descent planning as restrictions can be programmed directly and a profile calculated. There are other ad hoc methods for determining the distance required to lose a given amount of altitude. The “3 to 1” rule is still used by most pilots to back up the FMS solution in which 3 miles are required for every 1000 ft of altitude loss, e.g. 30,000 feet would require 90 miles. Adjustments are then made to accommodate headwinds/tailwinds and anticipated speed restrictions.
Destination weather and the expected approach/runway procedures are major considerations in planning the arrival. The primary source of this information is the ATIS previously described, although holding delays, weather conditions and runway operations may be passed along via ATC and/or dispatch. ATIS provides the current weather, instrument approach procedures in use, and active runways, as well as details concerning runway and taxiway closures, windshear reports, precise visibility values for individual runways, braking capability, bird activity, temporary obstructions (e.g. construction), land and hold short operations utilization and any other relevant safety-related information.
Once the crew has received the destination weather and approach information, they begin setting up the navigation equipment for the expected arrival procedure. Of primary concern are the current weather conditions vs. the available approach procedures. Low ceilings and visibility mandate specialized procedures which in turn require specific navigation equipment necessary for executing the approaches. If the current weather is below the minimums available for the procedure in use, or the necessary equipment is unavailable or inoperative, the crew must consider other options which include holding (if weather improvement is anticipated) or diverting to an alternate airport. Either course of action requires coordination with ATC and the airline’s dispatch office.
After the crew has programmed the navigation systems and FMS for the anticipated procedure, the PF briefs the approach, using the published approach procedure as a reference. Some low visibility weather situations may mandate that the Captain always perform the PF duties to meet standardization requirements during critical low visibility operations. In addition to designating the PF, the approach briefing includes information about the required navaids, key segment and crossing altitudes, approach minimums vs. current weather, obstacles and terrain awareness, and the missed approach procedure.
The cabin crew activities during the descent include preparing the cabin and galleys for landing, forwarding connecting gate information to the passengers, completing customs-related documents, forwarding any cabin-related discrepancies to the cockpit and verifying that seatbelt compliance requirements are satisfied. The Captain’s descent PA announcement usually includes updates of arrival estimates and weather conditions. Any anticipated adverse weather or delays are usually briefed to both cabin crew and passengers.
As the aircraft descends below the transition level, the PNF works on completing the descent checklist which includes monitoring the pressurization, correcting any accumulated fuel imbalance, and calculating and/or reviewing landing data (approach speeds, runway limits). While passing through 10,000 feet, the Captain alerts the cabin crew (by chime or PA) that the sterile cockpit period is in effect and that the final cabin preparations for landing should be completed.",""

"id-30f8f97b-ac31-41b2-88d0-ececd20835a1","BusinessProcess","Final Approach","The aircraft operated by most air carriers are usually equipped to satisfy the navigation requirements of a variety of approach procedures. Precision approaches include Global Positioning System (GPS) autoland, GPS LNAV/VNAV and Category (CAT) I, II and III ILS approaches. Many runways at larger airports utilize the Instrument Landing System (ILS) to provide guidance to pilots during instrument conditions along a well-defined path made up of lateral and vertical elements called the localizer and glide slope respectively.
A non-precision approach is a procedure where lateral track information is provided by a local navigation aid (navaid) or satellite, but vertical guidance is received through barometric referencing or other means not directly associated with the specific runway. As expected, precision approaches provide for operations in much lower ceiling and visibility conditions.
When very low visibility conditions exist, CAT III approaches are mandated which require autoland or HUD (heads up display) guidance. Arrival delays should be anticipated during these operations due to limited spacing and runway options. When VFR (Visual Flight Rules) conditions exist, pilots are encouraged to use all available navaids as a back-up even during visual approaches. In addition, many airfields employ instrument procedures during VFR conditions in order to manage aircraft sequencing or noise restrictions.
At some point during the vectoring or feeder segment, the flight will be “cleared for the approach”. An approach clearance by ATC authorizes the crew to execute the procedures for landing. As mentioned earlier, it is the cockpit crew’s responsibility to determine approach legality. The current weather conditions must be compared to the procedures and equipment available, both ground-based and airborne. Downgrades in onboard automation or displays may dictate higher landing minimums and/or unavailability of certain procedures. Likewise, the inoperative status of any ground components may result in additional landing restrictions. An adverse condition of any required approach facilities is usually reported by ATC or the ATIS, but also may be detected by onboard alerting systems.
Most authorities designate a specific location in the procedure where the current weather must be at or above weather minimums in order for the aircraft to continue on the approach. If the flight passes the designated position with reported weather at or above minimums, it may continue to the missed approach point or decision height, as applicable. If weather conditions are below minimums at the designated position, the procedure must be aborted and other alternatives considered i.e. diversion, holding, etc.
Runway wind conditions must be addressed by the crew during the final approach and landing. Depending on the wind direction, intensity, and presence of gusts, adjustments may have to be made resulting in a higher planned approach speed. Maximum crosswind limitations vary among equipment type and weather conditions.
In the event the requirements for completing the approach and landing are not satisfied, a “go-around” is executed and a standardized “missed approach procedure” and/or ATC instructions must be followed. Options available following a missed approach include entering holding to wait out whatever unacceptable condition resulted in the aborted landing, diverting to an alternate airport, or most commonly, accepting ATC vectors to initiate another approach. Many aborted landings are initiated by ATC or the cockpit crew due to traffic on the runway. In most cases a prior arrival failed to clear the runway in a timely manner, but a delayed take-off by an aircraft sitting in position at the threshold can also result in an aborted landing.
If the runway is in-sight and clear when at the decision point, the cockpit crew continues the descent until initiating the landing “flare” maneuver where the descent rate is reduced just before touchdown.",""

Crews normally arrive earlier than one hour in order to accommodate international flight planning, publication/flight manual updating, or other administrative responsibilities. Once introductions between crewmembers are complete, the flight crew begins the planning tasks. In situations where the time available before departure is minimal, the First Officer may proceed to the aircraft to begin the preflight duties there.",""
"id-552399ff-3169-4c0c-b3ec-0d78cf6da1eb","BusinessProcess","Flight Crew Process","During this stage, the flight deck crew receives the so-called briefing package (containing the flight plan, current weather and fuel information, etc.) and cabin crew the passenger lists. This information is either printed out or, if available, electronic devices of the crew are updated with the information.
The crew must determine the airworthiness of the aircraft and address any open issues before departure. The term “preflight” is typically used to describe the interior and exterior inspections of the aircraft, but in a general sense can be used to describe any activity involved with preparing the aircraft for departure. The aircraft inspection is usually divided among the cockpit crew and includes an exterior walkaround examination, interior cockpit set-up, and systems checks. These preflight inspections are outlined in a checklist.
The preflight also includes verification that all required manuals and paperwork are onboard and complete. The aircraft mechanical logbook serves as a means for flight and cabin crews to convey mechanical discrepancies to station maintenance personnel and subsequent flight crews. Any discrepancy entered into the logbook must be balanced with an entry by a certified aircraft mechanic who either resolve the problem or defer it according to specified guidelines. Some items can be deferred based on time (hours of flight, or days/weeks), type of maintenance available, or whether they are listed in the Minimum Equipment List (MEL). The MEL identifies the components which may be inoperative on a given aircraft while still maintaining legality for dispatch as well as the deferral rules. Crew responses associated with MEL items range from simple awareness to complex critical procedural changes.
The Configuration Deviation List (CDL) is similar to the MEL, but references airframe components that are more structural in nature (e.g. missing flap track fairing).
Modern aircraft have extensive autoflight capabilities that allow many of the navigation and performance optimization tasks to be handled automatically if desired. Autoflight initialization and Flight Management System (FMS) programming are conducted during the pre-flight phase.
Some airlines have information systems which allow information required to initialize the autoflight systems to be uploaded automatically via an ACARS (Aircraft Communication and Reporting System) datalink unit. In general, the use of ACARS by air carriers satisfies the requirement that their aircraft are continuously able to be contacted by dispatch during the entire flight. Initialization of this system is also part of the cockpit setup procedures.
Communication between the cockpit and cabin crewmembers is critical to the safety and efficiency of the flight. At some point during or before preflight activities and passenger boarding, the Captain conducts a briefing with the Purser or senior “#1” flight attendant. This includes standard information covering en-route flight time and destination weather, as well as taxi-out time (in the case of a short taxi, the flight attendants must start the safety video/demonstration as early as practicable), security issues and alerts, ride conditions and turbulence, inoperative cabin components, requirement of overwater flight passenger life vest demonstrations, augmented crew, crew meal service and any other relevant safety or operational issues. The Captain may also discuss adherence to the sterile cockpit period in which access to the flight deck is limited to reduce distractions during critical flight phases, nominally anytime the aircraft is below 10,000 feet above Mean Sea Level (MSL).",""

The Captain acknowledges release of the parking brake and signals the First Officer to call ramp control (or ATC, depending on local requirements) for pushback clearance. Usually, the cockpit crew is advised by the pushback crew that the area is clear for engine start.
Under certain weather conditions, ice or frost may be present on the airframe or airfoil surfaces which require removal before take-off. In situations where deicing or anti-icing is required, the Captain delays the engine start while the push crew positions the aircraft in a designated de-ice location. At many airports, secondary de-icing locations are established nearer to the departure runway in order to keep the time to take-off below the holdover time. The holdover time is the length of time (in minutes) that the anti-icing fluid is effective and is determined by the flight crew from tables in their flight manuals. The time may vary according to temperature, type and intensity of precipitation, and type and concentration of fluid used. Once the anti-ice application is complete, the icing coordinator advises the cockpit crew when the holdover time begins. It is then the responsibility of the Captain to monitor the holdover time vs. take-off time. If the delay before take-off is too long, the aircraft may have to return to a de-icing location to be re-treated.
After the engines are started and the towbar is disconnected, the Captain gives the guideman permission to disconnect the interphone headset. The guideman then steps into a position where he is visible from the flight deck, shows the nulling pin (used to disable the aircraft’s nosewheel steering system during pushback) and gives a salute which confirms the ramp area is clear to taxi. The Captain acknowledges the salute and the First Officer calls for taxi clearance. Once clearance is received, the Captain begins the taxi-out only after both pilots have visually checked outside and verbally announced “clear left” and “clear right”.",""

Debriefs/reports are required by the cockpit crew in instances of a declared emergency or ATC violation, significant mechanical failures (including engine shutdown), fuel dumping, illness, injury or death of a passenger or crew member, passenger misconduct/smoking, overweight landing, HAZMAT issues, diversions, high speed aborts, lightning strikes, near midair collisions and a number of other situations involving non-standard operations or issues. Once all cockpit and cabin obligations are fulfilled, the crew begins preparations for the next flight leg. In situations where the same aircraft is to be used, a new flight plan is pulled up and the pre-flight sequence starts all over. In most cases, however, the crew must change aircraft and relocate to the new departure gate where the planning/preflight duties are repeated. If this is the last flight of the day, the crew is released from duty and typically proceeds to the crew hotel limo in cases of out of base layovers, or the bus to the employee parking lot if the inbound flight was the last leg of a sequence.
If the aircraft is to be “turned around” for use in a subsequent leg, maintenance personnel will attempt to meet the flight upon gate arrival. Any discrepancies are discussed with the inbound flight crew and the necessary repairs are begun as soon as possible. If the discrepancy has been reported in in-flight, the mechanics often meet the aircraft with replacement parts such as Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) which can often allow repair in the normally-scheduled turn-around window. If the aircraft is not to be used right away, required maintenance may be performed during periods of less demand. In situations where the aircraft is finished for the day, it may be towed or taxied to a remote location, or the hangar, where the requisite maintenance and/or inspections are completed. In addition to maintenance requirements, other post-flight activity conducted by ground personnel include aircraft cleaning and de-catering, security checks and any required customs inspections. When customs or security inspections are required, delays are often incurred since the outbound crew cannot access the aircraft until the inspection is complete. In any event, it is desirable from an efficiency standpoint that ground service activities associated with the inbound flight such as catering, cleaning, and baggage handling should dovetail with the departure cycles of subsequent flight legs.",""

The pilots finalize the FMS and autoflight parameters by obtaining an update on weather conditions and runway utilization through the Airport Terminal Information Service. In addition, the crew must receive confirmation of the flight’s routing from ATC. Prior to the scheduled departure (usually at least a few hours before), the airline’s dispatch office files a requested routing based on their flight plan optimization with ATC. Approximately 20 minutes prior to departure, the ATC route clearance is requested, preferably through an ACARS function. The ATC route clearance received by the crew may differ from the filed routing and the changes must be addressed (fuel/performance/dispatch considerations) and reprogrammed. In addition to possible routing changes, ATC may also adjust the planned departure time as a result of current airspace dynamics or weather conditions.
Latest at this stage, the cockpit will receive a signed load sheet from the loading agent. This typically includes finalized aircraft and fuel weights, stabilizer trim settings, center of gravity data, passenger count, cargo loading and live animal and security information. The First Officer uses the updated information to calculate finalized take-off performance data. The FO will also reset the stabilizer trim and set take-off reference speeds. In cases where the load sheet weights are greater than planned, adjustments may have to be made to the flap and/or power settings, or an alternate runway may be required. The load sheet is a critical document, because errors on it can have catastrophic consequences (e.g. plane crash due to wrong trimmings). Therefore, in many countries, the crew is obliged to cross-check the calculations for gross errors and, depending on regulations, the captain has to indicate concurrence with the figures by signing the load sheet. Often, copies of the signed load sheet are taken by various parties (e.g. load agent, airline, etc.) and kept for a defined period of time.
Once the clearance is received, the crew can perform the “Before Starting Engines” checklist. At approximately 10 minutes prior to departure, the Captain turns on the Fasten Seat Belt sign which signals the Flight Attendants to ready the cabin for departure and deliver the requisite PA announcements.
In order to prepare the aircraft for movement, the ground crew completes the baggage and cargo loading, including late bags, and closes the cargo doors. If necessary, any required external power or air is removed from the aircraft, unless required for engine start. The tug is connected to the aircraft via a towbar unless a “powerback” is planned. The flight deck crew performs the “just prior to pushback” portion of the checklist which includes, among other things, confirmation that all the doors are closed and that the anti-collision (red flashing) beacon is operating.

The term “preflight” is typically used to describe the interior and exterior inspections of the aircraft, but in a general sense can be used to describe any activity involved with preparing the aircraft for departure. The aircraft inspection is usually divided among the cockpit crew and includes an exterior walkaround examination, interior cockpit set-up, and systems checks. These preflight inspections are outlined in a checklist.
The preflight also includes verification that all required manuals and paperwork are onboard and complete. The aircraft mechanical logbook serves as a means for flight and cabin crews to convey mechanical discrepancies to station maintenance personnel and subsequent flight crews. Any discrepancy entered into the logbook must be balanced with an entry by a certified aircraft mechanic who either resolve the problem or defer it according to specified guidelines. Some items can be deferred based on time (hours of flight, or days/weeks), type of maintenance available, or whether they are listed in the Minimum Equipment List (MEL). The MEL identifies the components which may be inoperative on a given aircraft while still maintaining legality for dispatch as well as the deferral rules. Crew responses associated with MEL items range from simple awareness to complex critical procedural changes.
The Configuration Deviation List (CDL) is similar to the MEL, but references airframe components that are more structural in nature (e.g. missing flap track fairing).
Modern aircraft have extensive autoflight capabilities that allow many of the navigation and performance optimization tasks to be handled automatically if desired. Autoflight initialization and Flight Management System (FMS) programming are conducted during the pre-flight phase.
Some airlines have information systems which allow information required to initialize the autoflight systems to be uploaded automatically via an ACARS (Aircraft Communication and Reporting System) datalink unit. In general, the use of ACARS by air carriers satisfies the requirement that their aircraft are continuously able to be contacted by dispatch during the entire flight. Initialization of this system is also part of the cockpit setup procedures.
Communication between the cockpit and cabin crewmembers is critical to the safety and efficiency of the flight. At some point during or before preflight activities and passenger boarding, the Captain conducts a briefing with the Purser or senior “#1” flight attendant. This includes standard information covering en-route flight time and destination weather, as well as taxi-out time (in the case of a short taxi, the flight attendants must start the safety video/demonstration as early as practicable), security issues and alerts, ride conditions and turbulence, inoperative cabin components, requirement of overwater flight passenger life vest demonstrations, augmented crew, crew meal service and any other relevant safety or operational issues. The Captain may also discuss adherence to the sterile cockpit period in which access to the flight deck is limited to reduce distractions during critical flight phases, nominally anytime the aircraft is below 10,000 feet above Mean Sea Level (MSL).",""

"id-86d79d5a-9e45-406d-9b63-c818e6847c95","BusinessProcess","Take-Off","In order to make most efficient use of runway resources, the local tower controller often issues a “position and hold” clearance to an aircraft in preparation for final take-off clearance. This allows the aircraft to taxi into position and hold on the departure runway while waiting for other traffic, runway restrictions or an ATC issued departure time. If this hold time is not required or a departure needs to be expedited, the tower may clear the flight for take-off without holding in position. At this time the crew makes final checks of the wind/weather and the presence of runway contamination. If the flight is following the departure of a large aircraft, adequate wake separation requirements must be assured by confirming that an acceptable interval of time has elapsed before commencing the take-off roll.
Once the take-off clearance is received, the pilots’ roles of Captain/First Officer change to pilot-flying/pilot not-flying (PF/PNF) in order to accomplish the procedures commensurate with which pilot is flying the leg. At all times, however, the Captain is still pilot-in-command (PIC) and, since he/she remains responsible for the flight and may choose to assume the PF role at his/her discretion. Certain weather conditions (low visibility) or crew experience levels may dictate that the Captain remain PF during some or all of the flight.
During the take-off roll, the crew monitors the aircraft centerline tracking, engine parameters, and conditions both inside and outside of the aircraft. The PNF calls out each V-speed as part of the normal procedure. Should a critical problem occur before the abort decision speed, V1, the take-off is rejected and the aircraft is stopped on the runway.
An uneventful take-off is followed by a normal initial climb-out which includes “cleaning up” the aircraft (gear raised, flaps/slats retracted) while conforming to any noise and/or obstacle requirements.",""
"id-15dcaf18-340c-46d6-a4da-03b83ae8833c","BusinessProcess","Taxi-in","The pilots use taxiway charts of the destination airport to assist in the execution of taxi clearances given to them by ATC. Pilots must be diligent during ground operations at airports with which they are unfamiliar or that are undergoing construction. Operations during nighttime or heavy precipitation also require special consideration and may substantially impede the overall traffic movement on the airfield. At some point during taxi-in the Captain determines the necessity of starting the APU. In the interest of fuel conservation, an engine may be shutdown which may require utilizing the APU, depending on the aircraft type. Normally the APU is started while the aircraft is a few minutes from the gate area, unless it has been determined that ground power will be used. In that case, the APU is not started and an engine is left running after gate arrival until the ground electric is connected by the guide crew.
If the arrival gate is occupied, the aircraft may be required to wait out the delay at a remote location. Occupied gates are often the result of a delayed departure or other operational issues with the aircraft currently positioned at the gate and the anticipated delay should be passed on to ATC and the passengers. Once clearance to the gate is received, the Captain taxis to the ramp area and visually acquires the marshallers. After the crew confirms the gate area is unobstructed, the marshallers utilize lighted wands to signal clearance to taxi to the stop point adjacent to the jetbridge. Often delays are encountered at this point due to the unavailability of the ground crew, carts or vehicular traffic in the gate area, or a tow-in requirement for the assigned gate (in which the aircraft engines are shut down and a tug is used to tow the aircraft onto the gate position). Some stations utilize automatic parking systems which employ an arrangement of lights and/or signs that the Captain uses for lead-in line and stopping position guidance. In the absence of self-guidance, the marshaller uses wand signals to direct and stop the aircraft at the desired location. Once the brakes are parked, the agent moves the jetbridge into position at the entry door, or in the case of airstair disembarkation, positions the truck(s) under the appropriate exit door(s).",""
"id-4069f62f-1b3e-4302-8869-387c7f3817bb","BusinessProcess","Taxi-Out","As in the case of pushback, anytime ground movement is initiated, permission must be received from the controlling authority. At some point before leaving the ramp area, the First Officer contacts ground control to get taxi clearance to the active runway. 
At this stage, any last minute changes (LMC) to the load sheet are received via ACARS or by radio. These may result in the reprogramming of affected parameters and too high take-off weight may dictate the request for a special runway which can result in a taxi and/or take-off delay while ATC works out a modified sequence. Once the load sheet information is processed, the crew completes the “taxi” and “before take-off” checklists. 
At some point, the Captain conducts a take-off briefing which includes which pilot will be making the take-off, initial heading, altitude and departure procedure requirements, obstacle clearance and noise abatement issues, airport elevation and the normal cleanup altitude. In addition, the briefing must address runway abort considerations, engine out procedures and associated cleanup altitudes, and emergency contingencies requiring returning to the departure point or other proximate landing options.   In situations where there will be a long taxi due to numerous departures ahead in sequence for take-off, it is desirable for the Captain to make a PA announcement informing the passengers and cabin crew of his/her best estimate of the length of the delay. This is typically done by counting the number of aircraft ahead in the take-off queue. If the delay is significant, the airline may have to be updated via ACARS or radio with a new ETD (estimated time of departure). As the aircraft approaches the departure end of the runway, the Captain makes a departure PA announcement to inform the flight attendants that the take-off is imminent and they should secure themselves at their stations. The Captain must assure that the passenger briefing has been completed, which may be a factor in short taxi-out situations.",""
"id-2bced6dd-9523-4a66-b7e4-4ff6a8b6b344","BusinessProcess","Terminal Area Arrival","Terminal area maneuvering generally begins when the aircraft descends below 10,000 feet about 30 to 40 miles from the destination airport. At this point the flight path is defined by the vectors from ATC. Radar vectors consist of heading directives issued to the pilots and are used by ATC for the sequencing and/or spacing of air traffic. In non-radar environments, the flight is operated along established airways or feeder routes to an initial approach point defined by the approach procedure in use. In either case, the crew must keep a vigilant traffic watch and maintain terrain awareness (using electronic aids, charts, visual, etc) especially in mountainous areas and/or areas of high traffic congestion
As the flight nears the position where it will commence the approach, the crew may be issued additional real time landing information or instructions. Braking action reports are given by previous arrivals and include a qualitative ranking of the braking effectiveness during rollout after touchdown. Certain braking action conditions may require the utilization of specified on-board systems such as autobrakes and/or autospoilers, or may dictate that the flight enter holding until the runway condition can be improved through plowing or chemical treatment. In low visibility conditions, real time RVR (Runway Visual Range) reports are issued to the arriving flights for the purpose of determining approach legality, or applying other operating restrictions to the flight (e.g. crosswind limitations, autoland requirements, etc.). ATC. Microburst alerts and airspeed loss/gain reports from prior arrivals are also passed on to the crew. Adjustments may have to be made to reference landing speeds to operate under such conditions. In many cases, the flight will have to enter holding to wait out low visibility, poor braking, or windshear/microburst conditions",""
"id-21fca597-2e4f-43c7-b43e-7f29e00bbc31","BusinessProcess","Terminal Area Departure","The climb flight profile is determined by both ATC/airspace requirements, and performance characteristics which may be aircraft-specific. When clear of the immediate airport traffic area, the aircraft is accelerated to maximum low altitude climb speed unless a restriction has been issued by ATC. Terminal-area airspace may be very complex and certain standard procedures have been developed for both departing and arriving flights at high-density locations. During climb-out the flight typically conforms to a standard Departure Procedure (DP).
As the aircraft climbs through approximately 1500 feet above ground level (AGL), the flight attendants are notified (by a chime) that they may commence their service duties. When 10,000 feet MSL is reached, the aircraft is accelerated to the optimal climb speed. In addition, the flight attendants are again chimed to indicate the end of the sterile cockpit period.",""
