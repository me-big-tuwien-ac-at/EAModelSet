The Base Registry Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because base registries include ""authorative sources of information"", that need to be properly governed and made available. EIF's includes base registries in the conceptual model for integrated public services, and describes it as ""the cornerstone of European public service delivery"". EIF gives several recommendations on how to manage and interact with base registries (recommendation 37, 38, 39 and 40).

GOOD PRACTICES ON BUILDING SUCESSFUL INTERCONNECTIONS OF BASE REGISTRIES
In order to provide quick and user-friendly public services to citizens and businesses, public administrations are trying to adopt customer-centric approaches and readjust their ways of working.
One way to achieve efficiency and increase user-friendliness is through the ‘once-only principle’. Instead of asking the citizen for information that they have already provided, public administrations will reuse the information they already have. Much of this information is stored in authoritative databases called base registries. As the authentic sources of data for public administrations, base registries are one of the basic building blocks of public services and are the key to making the once-only principle a reality.
The document contains some good practices to foster access to the data contained in these base registries.
The good practices presented, are grouped according to the layered interoperability model proposed by the European Interoperability
Framework (EIF).

To achieve text encoding, a large variety of character encodings have been devised. Character encodings can loosely be explained as mappings between the character sequences that users manipulate and the sequences of bits that computers manipulate.

Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8)

ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8.
UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.
UTF-8 has a one-octet encoding unit.  It uses all bits of an octet, but has the quality of preserving the full US-ASCII [US-ASCII] range: US-ASCII characters are encoded in one octet having the normal US-ASCII value, and any octet with such a value can only stand for a US-ASCII character, and nothing else.
UTF-8 encodes UCS characters as a varying number of octets, where the number of octets, and the value of each, depend on the integer value assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646 (the character number, a.k.a. code position, code point or Unicode scalar value).

Core Vocabularies are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. 
Public administrations can use and extend the Core Vocabularies in the following contexts:
• Development of new systems: the Core Vocabularies can be used as a default starting point for designing the conceptual and logical data models in newly developed information systems.
• Information exchange between systems: the Core Vocabularies can become the basis of a context-specific data model used to exchange data among existing information systems.
• Data integration: the Core Vocabularies can be used to integrate data that comes from disparate data sources and create a data mash-up.
• Open data publishing: the Core Vocabularies can be used as the foundation of a common export format for data in base registries like cadastres, business registers and service portals. 
• ISA² has developed the Core Vocabularies for public administrations in an open process with the active involvement of specific working groups. The Core Vocabularies developed are the following:
- Core Person: captures the fundamental characteristics of a person, e.g. name, gender, date of birth, location.
- Registered organisation: captures the fundamental characteristics of a legal entity (e.g. its identifier, activities) which is created through a formal registration process, typically in a national or regional register.

EURES - Job vacancy
Most of the jobs on the EURES Job Mobility Portal come from the job vacancies databases managed by the Public Employment Services of the countries participating in EURES. Using a technology called Web Services, the EURES search engine instantly, in real time, interrogates each national database for jobs. These jobs can be of two types:
“EURES jobs"", displayed with a blue flag, which are jobs where an employer has expressed an interest in recruiting from another country, or any other jobs advertised in the national jobs databases.
There is, in addition, a central database where EURES advisers can manually post jobs that will all be flagged as ""EURES jobs"". This is for the time being the only way for those few countries that are not yet fully connected to Web Services to advertise jobs on the EURES portal. This solution can, however, also be used for other specific purposes, such as when an employer wishes to publish a vacancy in several languages etc., which may not always be possible in a national database.

ESPD - Exchange data model 
The ESPD exchange data model (ESPD-EDM) is used for the ESPD service provided by the European Commission.
The ESPD Exchange Data Model was designed to implement the data requirements expressed in the Annex 2 of the COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/7 of 5 January 2016 (from now on ""the Annex to the Regulation 2016/7""), establishing the standard form for the European Single Document. Additionally to these requirements, the model took also into account the Information Requirements Model specified by the CEN/BII-Workshops.[3] (namely Workshop 3), and the latest developments relating to the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) in e-Sens.[4].
One premise that has ruled the design and implementation life-cycle of the ESPD-EDM has been ''not to reinvent the wheel''. Thus some very early key decisions were: 

(i) select a mature business language for the naming, design and implementation of the ESPD-EDM; 
(ii) reuse as much as possible existing information components and libraries ''as-they-are''; 
(iii) for those entities that are not defined in any standard specification, design new components in such a way that they can be reused in other situations and domains, both in e-Procurement and beyond e-Procurement.

OASIS UBL-2.1 standard was chosen as the best candidate to base the ESPD-EDM upon. The main reasons for this decisions were: 
i. The European Commission is already using (and recommending) UBL-2.1 for e-Documents.[5] ; 
ii. Most of the concepts and components necessary for the ESPD documents were already defined by UBL specifically for e-Procurement; (3) Methodology and tools are available for the development of new documents, the extension of the existing UBL libraries, the semantic validation of XML instances, etc.

A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. The internal representation of a UUID is a specific sequence of bits in memory, as described in Section 4.  To accurately represent a UUID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the bit sequence to a string representation. Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant digit first.  The hexadecimal values ""a"" through ""f"" are output as lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.

Interoperable Digital Public Services Implementation Orientation ABB is a Business Object setting decision making rules/criteria/principles followed at implementing a digital public services through organisations, persons, objects or events 

The following implementation orientations are identified in the literature: integration, technology, governance and legal.

• The INTEGRATION ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on data resources and on information management capabilities to manage information resources over their life cycle (i.e. scanning, collecting, organising, processing, maintaining, etc.) to understand societal needs, to embed data throughout the policy cycle, and to develop a culture of data analytics (OECD, 2018). The integration orientation will be based on semantic interoperability aiming for the design of a shared knowledge base of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables:
i) structural interoperability by using and/or sharing of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge (i.e. data set catalogue, base registries, catalogue of ontologies); 
ii) behavioural interoperability by exchanging capabilities of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge with the environment (i.e. representation, data mappings); and
iii) governance interoperability by semantic interoperability agreements (i.e. ontologies).  

• The TECHNOLOGY ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on ICT resources like solutions and infrastructure and on ICT management capabilities to manage the provision of services (i.e. business operations, decision making, internal support, etc.) to users and the consumption of services by ministries and agencies (OECD, 2018). The technology orientation will be based on technical interoperability aiming for the design of a shared platform of ICT resources (i.e. the platform) that enables:
i) structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of software components (i.e. service registry service, networks, reusable building blocks, common [back office] services);
ii) behavioural interoperability with ICT exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. intermediation services, interfaces); an
iii) governance interoperability with technical interoperability agreements (i.e. protocols, choreography rules).

• The GOVERNANCE ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on the governance resources (Grant et al., 2007) and on governance management capabilities/archetypes to manage the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) for the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) to achieve a more agile, effective, and digitally inclusive public engagement, to increase trust in government, and to enhance government transparency (OECD, 2018; Weill & Woodham, 2002). The governance orientation will be based on organisational interoperability aiming for the design of a shared governance framework of [re]usable organisational resources that enables:
i) structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogue);
ii) behavioural interoperability with organisational exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. service delivery model); and
iii) governance interoperability with organisational interoperability agreements (i.e. service level agreements, governance structures).

• The LEGAL ORIENTATION (Santosuossa and Malerba, 2014) is characterized by a focus on legal and regulatory frameworks based in displayed leadership and political commitment to ensure adaptation to rapidly changing technological and diverse social environments with high-level requirements to achieve coherence and effective support to digital public services implementation (OECD, 2018). The legal orientation will be based in legal interoperability aiming for the design of a shared legal framework of [re]usable legal resources that enables:
i) structural interoperability by legislation on reusing and/or sharing orientation and guidelines (i.e. legislation catalogue, interoperability reference architectures);
ii) behavioural interoperability by legislation on exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. interoperability frameworks); and
iii) governance interoperability by legislation on governance agreements (i.e. GDPR).

The directive sets out rules on the use of public contracts for the provision of works, supplies or services by companies or individuals and the exemptions which can be applied. The legislation specifies that when national authorities use public procurement to invite tenders to provide works, supplies or services, they must treat all applicants equally and not discriminate between them. They must also be transparent in their dealings. This Directive is considered as a Legal Interoperability Specification, as it shall be transposed in a National or Regional Binding Instrument when designing the solution using the e-procurement Solution Architecture Template.

Non-binding Instrument ABB is a Business Object, involving no obligation, which are available to the European institutions to carry out their tasks. The European non-binding, declaratory instruments listed in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are recommendations and opinions:
• Recommendations are non-mandatory acts issued by the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, or the European Central Bank which suggest a certain form of conduct to those to whom they are addressed without imposing any legal obligations.
• Opinions are non-binding legal acts adopted by the European institutions which do not bind those to whom they are addressed.

Public administrations communications are not non-binding instruments. For example, in the EC, a Communication (i.e. on the European Interoperability Framework) is part of a standard procedure followed facing a new policy challenge. It is a policy paper, addressed to EU lawmakers, to inform them of the situation, and usually including proposals for solving the problem. The Communication is usually preceded by a public consultation, in which the EC invites all interested parties (including citizens, businesses, associations, local authorities etc.) to provide their point of view on the topic.

Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also provides for non binding legal instruments.
- Recommendations call upon the party to whom they are addressed to behave in a particular way without placing them under any legal obligation
- Opinions issued by the EU institutions give assessments of situations or developments in the Union or in the individual Member States. They may also also prepare the way for subsequent, legally binding acts, or be a prerequisite for the institution of proceedings before the Court of Justice
Recommendations and Opinions have moral and political significance, without being legally binding
The three other main forms of actions that shape the EU legal order without having legally binding effect are Resolutions, Declarations and Action programmes.

Action Plan for the future of Organic Production in the European Union
The Commission launched a consultation for the review of the European policy on organic agriculture in 2012-2013. This consultation has also been an opportunity to consult experts, stakeholders and the public on areas where a new action plan might be needed. To help organic farmers, producers and retailers adjust to the proposed policy changes and meet future challenges, the Commission has also approved an Action Plan on the future of Organic Production in Europe. The Plan foresees to better inform farmers on rural development and EU farm policy initiatives encouraging organic farming, to strengthen links between EU research and innovation projects and organic production and to encourage the use of organic food, e.g. in schools.

EUCARIS - registry network
EUCARIS is an initiative of several European countries and can be described as a cooperation between several national registration authorities. Formalised in a multilateral treaty, this cooperation is focused on the data-exchange regarding vehicle registration, driving licences, and the accompanying personal data. For this exchange, a system is used which was especially developed for this purpose: EUCARIS II. It is essential to note that EUCARIS makes no use of a central European database. Each country is responsible for its own registry of vehicle and driving licence information and its own registration procedures. Through their national registration authority other government institutions can request information on e.g. vehicles from another country. The national registration authority becomes a central hub in EUCARIS.

Open Contracting Data Standard schema-level mapping - Template and guidance
This guide details an example of using the OCDS 1.1 Field Level Mapping Template to map the fields from a single table in a fictional e-GP system to OCDS. 

Step 1: Source System Details
OCDS data may originate in multiple source systems, therefore it is important to record the details of the source system we are mapping from. 
Step 2: Source Field Details
Using the (Source) Fields sheet, populate the following information for each field in the source table: the system the field is from (as recorded in step 1); the table in which the field is located; the field title.
Where additional context is required you may also record a narrative description of the source field in the description field and it might also be useful to add an example of the value that the field takes alongside further technical information on the type and multiplicity of the field.
Step 3: Mapping
The mapping template has a sheet for each stage of the contracting process, from (OCDS) 2. Planning through to (OCDS) 6. Implementation, with details of the relevant fields from the OCDS schema, in addition to the (OCDS) 1. General (all stages) sheet which contains fields relevant to all stages of the contracting process. Review each of the (OCDS) sheets in the mapping template to identify fields in the OCDS schema to which a field in the source system can be mapped. 
Step 4: Review
Repeat steps 1-3 for all tables and all source systems to complete the mapping.
Gaps in currently held data: if you identify data OCDS requests, but that you do not hold, engage with data users to consider whether this additional data could and should be provided.
Gaps in OCDS: you might have data which is not covered by OCDS. In these cases, talk with the OCDS helpdesk to see whether this should be included in an extension to the standard. Additional fields can be documented at the bottom of each mapping sheet in the template.

The EU cybersecurity certification framework
The European Commission puts forward the creation of a EU certification framework for ICT security products in its 2017 proposal for a regulation.
On 13 September 2017 the Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the """"EU Cybersecurity Agency"""", and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification (''Cybersecurity Act'').
Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the digital single market. At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificates, there is an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market.
The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards.
The certification will attest that ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service.
The schemes proposed in the future European framework will rely as much as possible on international standards as a way to avoid creating trade barriers and ensuring coherence with international initiatives.""

date: Because we want to perform automated operations like sorting on the date, we can select the Dublin Core property dcterms:date. This property can take a string value. We can indicate that the value string is formatted in accordance with the W3C Date and Time Formats specification by using syntax encoding scheme dcterms:W3CDTF.
language: The language needs to be selected from a controlled list. We achieve this by requiring the use of three-letter codes listed in the international standard ISO 639-3 for the representation of names of languages (such as """"eng"""" for """"English"""") together with the syntax encoding scheme dcterms:ISO639-3 as a datatype. For this, we can use the DCMI property dcterms:language, which can accommodate either an identifier for the language term or a string.

Published datasets are organized by ""communities"" and their member ""collections"". Globus users can create and manage their own communities and collections through the data publication service. A collection enables the submission of datasets with policies regarding access.
A dataset comprises data and metadata. Policies can be set on communities or collections to manage:
- Metadata (schema, requirements)
- Access control (user and group based)
- Curation workflow
- Submission and distribution licenses
- Storage
Datasets undergo curation based on a workflow defined by the community that will publish the data. Workflows may be customized by each community to capture their specific metadata and to reflect the community's review process. After the dataset is published, it is discoverable using a faceted search that allows the researcher to progressively filter results and rapidly focus in on the data of interest. The data may then be transferred to a Globus endpoint where the investigator can inspect and further process the data.

Form Tools is a forms framework written in PHP and MySQL. You download and install the script on your own website. At its heart, Form Tools is a web form creator, processor, data storage and access script. It was originally designed to work with any existing web form, but has since been expanded to create forms automatically as well.
Form Tools is extremely versatile in how it integrates with your forms. You can use the bundled Form Builder module to create the forms automatically on your website (no programming or HTML skills necessary); you can use the PHP API to integrate your own custom form with the script; or you can simply POST your form to Form Tools, and just use it to store the form data. Anything goes! You can read about the different integration methods / form creation methods here.
Form Tools works by creating custom database tables to store your unique form data. It provides a range of functionality customized to your data set, such as allowing you to view, update, cross-reference and export your submission data, create subsets of your data for viewing/editing by client accounts, data visualizations, and much more.

Improvements in Log4j 2:
• Log4j 2 is designed to be usable as an audit logging framework. 
• Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency than Log4j 1.x and Logback.
• Log4j 2 is garbage free for stand-alone applications, and low garbage for web applications during steady state logging. This reduces pressure on the garbage collector and can give better response time performance.
• Log4j 2 uses a Plugin system that makes it extremely easy to extend the framework by adding new Appenders, Filters, Layouts, Lookups, and Pattern Converters without requiring any changes to Log4j.
• Support for custom log levels. Custom log levels can be defined in code or in configuration.

Shared platform ABB is a Application Component setting technical (re)usable resources with convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from a technical perspective cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. This convergence power is based on the instrumental nature and efficiencies  of these resources for enabling common problem-solving approaches. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared platform (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the technical perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared platform (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the technical perspective). The level of technical interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared platform enables:
i)          structural interoperability with technical resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. service registry service);
ii)         behavioural interoperability with technical resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Technical interfaces); and
iii)        governance interoperability with technical resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge(i.e. Technical Interoperability Agreements).

Camunda
The core of Camunda BPM is a model execution engine that supports the OMG standards BPMN 2.0 for process automation, CMMN 1.1 for case management and DMN 1.1 for decision management.
Camunda BPM ships with a set of applications to help you model, execute and administer process applications running on the Camunda core engine. Those applications interact with the core engine's public REST API. You can also create your own applications that may also use the core engine's public Java API. It is lightweight and requires less than 3MB of disk space. It can run in any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and comes with extended integration for different runtime containers.
The engine can be accessed via the REST API, or via the Java API and existing integrations with Spring and Java EE can be used. BPMN service tasks can be implemented in Java code, or the built-in REST and SOAP connectors can be used. Scripts, expressions and templates can also be applied for process implementation. Clustering for horizontal scalability is straightforward as the engine is stateless: multiple instances can share the same database.
BPMN 2.0 Processes permits the fully automated service orchestration and human workflow management.

European Data Portal 
The European Data Portal harvests the metadata of Public Sector Information available on public data portals across European countries. Information regarding the provision of data and the benefits of re-using data is also included.
What is Open Data?
- Open (Government) Data refers to the information collected, produced or paid for by the public bodies (also referred to as Public Sector Information) and made freely available for re-use for any purpose. The licence will specify the terms of use. 
- Public sector information is information held by the public sector. The Directive on the re-use of public sector information provides a common legal framework for a European market for government-held data. It is built around the key pillars of the internal market: free flow of data, transparency and fair competition. It is important to note that not all of the public sector information is Open Data.
Within the Portal, sections are dedicated to:
- Searching datasets: Categories have been established to structure the metadata harvested from the various countries. These categories follow the revision of the DCAT Application Profile and have been mapped against the Eurovoc Thesaurus.
- Providing Data: This section gives an insight into understanding Open Data from the perspective of a data provider. In addition, instructions are offered for those who wish their data portal to be harvested by the European Data Portal.
- Using Data: How Open Data is being used, as well as the economic benefits of Open Data are detailed in this section.
- Training and Library: eLearning modules about Open Data as well as training guides and a knowledge base referencing publications around Open Data and featured projects.
Portals can be national, regional, local or domain specific. They cover the 28 EU Member States, EEA, countries involved in the EU's neighbourhood policy and Switzerland.

Belgian Data Portal
The Belgian Data Portal provides data (more than 6500 datasets), tools and resources.
Open Data is a driver for innovation, economic growth, transparency and participation. According to a European study (ref.COM (2011) 882) the cumulative economic benefits arising from the provision of public data would amount to € 40 billion per year in the EU. These data lend themselves to reuse in the context of new products and services and can improve the efficiency of public authorities. Making public sector data accessible makes it possible to involve citizens more in political and social life and to make an active contribution to policy areas such as the environment, mobility, the economy, and so on.
The 2014-2018 Belgian government agreement states that the government will focus on opening public sector data (Open Data policy). Open public data is now the rule. Public services make available to citizens, researchers, companies and public authorities the reuse of data already available to them in the framework of their missions.
It is more specifically data that:
- Public services have collected as part of their data collection missions;
- Do not contain (more) privacy-sensitive information that is not protected by intellectual property rights held by third parties;
- Are published in a format that is easy to reuse automatically (""machine readable "");
- Can be reused for commercial and non-commercial purposes.
It is not only a matter of making public service data available, but also of building a community environment around these data. Companies can reuse some data and enrich it with their own information to market new products and services. Citizens benefit from more transparent public authorities and public services can help improve the quality of existing public data and services.

freeTSA.org offers free NTP and DNSCRYPT services
freeTSA.org provides a free Time Stamp Authority. Adding a trusted timestamp to code or to an electronic signature provides a digital seal of data integrity and a trusted date and time of when the transaction took place.
Trusted timestamping is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification times of a document. Security here means that no one - not even the owner of the document - should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. FreeTSA trusted timestamping Software as a Service (SaaS) provides an easy method to apply RFC 3161 trusted timestamps to time-sensitive transactions through independently verified and auditable date and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) sources.

Graylog2 - open source log management platform
Graylog2 is an open source log management platform. Each message is saved in an Elasticsearch database and a web interface allows to manage and analyse the logs.
Graylog2 is divided into two parts: graylog2-server and graylog2-web-interface. The first is a Java application that accepts messages on different protocols: UDP, TCP, GELF, AMQP... Each message is analysed and saved in the Elasticsearch database. A Rest API is also integrated into the tool and is used in particular by the web-interface part. This allows to manage users, streams and dashboards. 
Some possible uses: 
• Centralization of the logs: several types of inputs: syslog, GELF, raw... Rather than having to connect to each of the servers to consult the error logs, they can be configured to send all the messages in Graylog2.
• Debug application
• Exception handling
• Log analysis
For example, it can easily list the clients who are still using the deprecated version of an API. Another search can e.g. allow you to list the largest consumers or the most used parts of an API.
Graylog Enterprise is built on top of the Graylog open source platform and offers additional features: 
• Archiving: automatically archive the data that are not searched through very often. Store this data on more cost-effective, slower hard disks and make it available for search in Graylog only when needed.
• Audit Log: Graylog Enterprise also offers Audit Log capabilities. Audit Log records and stores actions taken by a user or administrator that make changes in the Graylog system.

Belgian national register

The National Register refers to the information processing system which records, stores and communicates information relating to the identification of natural persons ie citizens.

It is therefore a central database in which are recorded:
• all Belgians residing in Belgium;
• all Belgians residing abroad who register in the population registers held in Belgian diplomatic missions or consular posts abroad;
• all foreigners residing in Belgium who are admitted or authorized to settle or reside in the Kingdom;
• all foreigners (and their family members) who declare themselves refugees or who are seeking recognition of refugee status.

ESPD - Exchange data model 
The ESPD exchange data model (ESPD-EDM) is used for the ESPD service provided by the European Commission.
The ESPD Exchange Data Model was designed to implement the data requirements expressed in the Annex 2 of the COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/7 of 5 January 2016 (from now on ""the Annex to the Regulation 2016/7""), establishing the standard form for the European Single Document. Additionally to these requirements, the model took also into account the Information Requirements Model specified by the CEN/BII-Workshops.[3] (namely Workshop 3), and the latest developments relating to the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) in e-Sens.[4].
One premise that has ruled the design and implementation life-cycle of the ESPD-EDM has been ''not to reinvent the wheel''. Thus some very early key decisions were: 

(i) select a mature business language for the naming, design and implementation of the ESPD-EDM; 
(ii) reuse as much as possible existing information components and libraries ''as-they-are''; 
(iii) for those entities that are not defined in any standard specification, design new components in such a way that they can be reused in other situations and domains, both in e-Procurement and beyond e-Procurement.

OASIS UBL-2.1 standard was chosen as the best candidate to base the ESPD-EDM upon. The main reasons for this decisions were: 
i. The European Commission is already using (and recommending) UBL-2.1 for e-Documents.[5] ; 
ii. Most of the concepts and components necessary for the ESPD documents were already defined by UBL specifically for e-Procurement; (3) Methodology and tools are available for the development of new documents, the extension of the existing UBL libraries, the semantic validation of XML instances, etc.

EUROSTAT - Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) 
Principle 1: Population thresholds
The NUTS regulation defines minimum and maximum population thresholds for the size of the NUTS regions:

Level        Minimum        Maximum
NUTS 1        3 000 000        7 000 000
NUTS 2        800 000        3 000 000
NUTS 3        150 000        150 000

For administrative levels of NUTS, it is sufficient if the average size of the corresponding regions lies within the thresholds; in case of non-administrative levels, each individual region should do so. Exceptions exist however in case of geographical, socio-economic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances.
Despite the aim of ensuring that regions of comparable size all appear at the same NUTS level, each level still contains regions which differ greatly in terms of population.
Principle 2: NUTS favours administrative divisions
For practical reasons the NUTS classification generally mirrors the territorial administrative division of the Member States. This supports the availability of data and the implementation capacity of policy.
Principle 3: Regular and extraordinary amendments
The NUTS classification can be amended, but generally not more frequently than every three years. The amendments are usually based on changes of the territorial structure in one or more Member States.
In case of a substantial reorganisation of the administrative structure of a Member State, amendments to the NUTS may be adopted at intervals of less than three years. This has only happened once so far, in 2014 for Portugal.

ZooKeeper
ZooKeeper is a centralized service registry for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.

Shared Knowledge Base ABB is a Data Object setting semantic (re)usable resources with convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from a semantic perspective cross public administrations, and cross borders. This convergence power is based on the enabling sense-making nature of these resources influencing the enactment of common understanding from the existing organisational information. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared knowledge base (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared knowledge base (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective). The level of semantic interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared knowledge base enables:
i)          structural interoperability with semantic resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. data set catalogue);
ii)         behavioural interoperability with semantic resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Metadata mappings); and
iii)        governance interoperability with semantic resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge cross legal jurisdictions (i.e. Sematic Interoperability Agreements).

The European Library of Architecture Principles (ELAP) ABB is a principle intended to direct government organizations in initiating changes and implementing IT projects. Particularly when designing new or modified services, it is necessary to make visible how the principles are implemented and which considerations are made in this regard. The apply-or-explain principle applies here, whereby deviations are permitted provided that they are substantiated and recorded with good arguments so that they can be revisited at a later stage. This prevents important matters from being overlooked.

Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups can use public services at service levels comparable to those provided to other citizens.

Inclusion and accessibility must be part of the whole development lifecycle of a European public service in terms of design, information content and delivery. It should comply with e-accessibility specifications widely recognised at European or international level.

Inclusion and accessibility usually involve multi-channel delivery. Traditional paper-based or face-to-face service delivery may need to co-exist with electronic delivery.

Inclusion and accessibility can also be improved by an information system’s ability to allow third parties to act on behalf of citizens who are unable, either permanently or temporarily, to make direct use of public services.

"id-14db2fec","Principle","Multilingualism","DEFINITION:
Multilingualism ABB is a Principle considering that European public services can potentially be used by anyone in any Member State. Citizens across Europe often have problems in accessing and using digital public services if these are not available in the languages they speak.

A balance needs to be found between the expectations of citizens and businesses to be served in their own language(s) or their preferred language(s) and the ability of Member States’ public administrations to offer services in all official EU languages. 
A suitable balance could be that European public services are available in the languages of the expected end-users, i.e. the number of languages is decided on the basis of users’ needs, such as the level to which the service is critical for the implementation of the digital single market or national policies, or the size of the relevant audience.

Multilingualism comes into play not just in the user interface, but at all levels in the design of European public services. For example, the choices made on data representation in an electronic database should not limit its ability to support different languages.

The multilingual aspect of interoperability becomes also relevant when a public service requires exchanges between information systems across language boundaries, as the meaning of the information exchanged must be preserved.

"id-ccc0755c","Principle","Openness","DEFINITION: 
Openness ABB is a Principle relating to data, specifications and software, in the context of interoperable public services.

Open government data (here simply referred ‘open data’) refers to the idea that all public data should be freely available for use and reuse by others, unless restrictions apply e.g. for protection of personal data, confidentiality, or intellectual property rights. Public administrations collect and generate huge amounts of data. The Directive on the reuse of public sector information (PSI)7 encourages Member States to make public information available for access and reuse as open data. The INSPIRE Directive8 requires, in addition, sharing of spatial datasets and services between public authorities with no restrictions or practical obstacles to its reuse. This data should be published with as few restrictions as possible and clear licences for its use to allow better scrutiny of administrations’ decision-making processes and realise transparency in practice.

The use of open source software technologies and products can help save development cost, avoid a lock-in effect and allow fast adaptation to specific business needs because the developer communities that support them are constantly adapting them. Public administrations should not only use open source software but whenever possible contribute to the pertinent developer communities. Open source is an enabler of the underlying EIF principle on reusability.

The level of openness of a specification/standard is decisive for the reuse of software components implementing that specification. This also applies when such components are used to introduce new European public services. If the openness principle applies in full:
* all stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the specification and a public review is part of the decision-making process;
* the specification is available for everyone to study;
* intellectual property rights to the specification are licensed on FRAND9 terms, in a way that allows implementation in both proprietary and open source software10, and preferably on a royalty-free basis.

Due to their positive effect on interoperability, the use of open specifications has been promoted in many policy statements and is encouraged for European public service delivery. The positive effect of open specifications is demonstrated by the internet ecosystem. However, public administrations may decide to use less open specifications if open ones do not exist or do not meet functional needs. In all cases, specifications should be mature and sufficiently supported by the market, unless they are being used to create innovative solutions.

Lastly, openness also means empowering citizens and businesses to get involved in the design of new services, to contribute to service improvement and to give feedback about the quality of the existing public services.

This means that records18 and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.

To guarantee the long-term preservation of electronic records and other kinds of information, formats should be chosen to ensure long-term accessibility, including preservation of associated electronic signatures or seals. In this regard, the use of qualified preservation services, in line with Regulation (EU) 910/2014, can ensure the long-term preservation of information.

For information sources owned and managed by national administrations, preservation is a purely national matter. For information that is not strictly national, preservation becomes a European issue. In that case, an appropriate ‘preservation policy’ should be applied by the Member States concerned, to cope with any difficulties arising if the relevant information is used under different jurisdictions.

"id-46032c1a","Principle","Reusability","DEFINITION:
Reusability ABB is a principle meaning that, public administrations confronted with a specific problem seek to benefit from the work of others by looking at what is available, assessing its usefulness or relevance to the problem at hand, and where appropriate, adopting solutions that have proven their value elsewhere. This requires the public administration to be open to sharing its interoperability solutions, concepts, frameworks, specifications, tools and components with others.

Reusability of IT solutions (e.g. software components, Application Programming Interfaces, standards), information and data, is an enabler of interoperability and improves quality because it extends operational use, as well as saving money and time. This makes it a major contributor to the development of a digital single market in the EU. Some EU standards and specifications also exist in the DIFs and should be applied more widely. For example, the INSPIRE Directive sets out interoperability standards for addresses, cadastres, roads and many other data topics of relevance to many public administrations. These existing standards and specifications can and should be used more widely beyond the domain for which they were originally developed.

Several public administrations and governments across the EU already promote sharing and reuse of IT solutions by adopting new business models, promoting the use of open source software for key ICT services and when deploying digital service infrastructure.

There are some key challenges that limit the sharing and reuse of IT solutions, at technical, organisational, legal and communication levels. The ISA² sharing and reuse framework for IT solutions12 provides recommendations for public administrations to help them overcome these challenges and share/reuse common IT solutions. Reuse and sharing can be effectively supported by collaborative platforms.

To foster trust in digital interactions with the public sector, suitable regulatory frameworks must be provided that ensure transparency, predictability, security-by-design and, where necessary, reinforcement or adjustment of existing provisions
