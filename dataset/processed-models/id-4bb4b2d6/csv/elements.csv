Budget plans show these types of expense amounts:

Budget plan ownership

Budget plans have a single owner, who must have the budget_owner role. Whoever you chose as the budget owner must also be associated with the budget plan's budget key as an owner.

Budget plan parent-child relationships

Budget plans can have one or more sub-plans, which roll up their actual budget amounts to the parent budget plan. You cannot promote child plans individually. Only the top-level plan in a hierarchy can be promoted.

The same account codes can be used for parent and any or all child plans, if necessary. Child plans can also have account codes that are lower in the hierarchy.

If you have multiple sub-plans with the same account codes, the amounts roll up from all subplans to the forecast.

Changing the fiscal period parent plan cascades the change down to all sub-plans. See Budget owners and budget key owners for more information.
