- Reference Architecture: Architecture is the structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time. A reference architecture is a generalized architecture of a solution, based on best-practices, domain neutral and, occasionally, with a focus on a particular aspect. The goal of a reference architecture is reusability; it reduces the amount of work, reduces errors and accelerates the development of solutions. A reference architecture should be based in a [reference] model and in a style. 
- Architectural framework: a tool for assisting in the production of organization-specific architectures. An architectural framework consists of a technical  reference model, a method for architecture development and a list of component standards, specifications, products and their interrelationships which can be used to build up architectures."

ii. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems.
iii. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations."
