Transparency of charging will encourage users to avoid expensive activities where slightly more inconvenient but far cheaper alternatives are available. For example, a user might browse a dump on screen rather than printing it off.

Charging is arguably the most complex of the three sub-processes, requiring a large investment of resources and a high degree of care to avoid anomalies, where an individual department may benefit from behavior which is detrimental to the company as a whole. Charging policy needs to be simultaneously simple, fair and realistic.

Charging need not necessarily mean money changing hands (full charging). It may take the form of information passed to management on the cost of provision of IT services (no charging), or may detail what would be charged if full charging were in place without transactions actually being applied to the financial ledgers (notional charging). Notional charging may also be used as a way of piloting full charging.

"7ef131c5","BusinessProcess","Charging","is the activity whereby payment is required for services delivered. Charging requires that accounting procedures and systems exist and are set up. It makes a difference whether the organization is an internal service provider, or if it serves external customer as its main business. In the case where an IT organization is an internal service provider (according to ITIL, these are Type I and Type II organizations), it is not necessary to bill for services. Sometimes such IT organizations only allocate costs. If an IT organization sells its services to external customers (Type III organization) they will, certainly, issue bills for their services and generate income which funds that organization.

Charging for services by an organization with external customers is the only way to get funding for the organization, cover costs and generate revenue. But, in the case of an internal service provider it can be seen as bureaucratic procedure, which is true. On the other side, I found that internal charging has several advantages:

It justifies IT resources needed (increased transparency),
users throughout organization use only resources they really need (optimization of usage),
business can plan their cost of operation (which is, further on, included in price charged to their customers), and

2.4.1 Process Overview
The Financial Management process provides the business and IT with the quantification (in financial terms) of the value of IT services, the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services, and the qualification of operational forecasting. It includes all function and processes responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging policies and activities.
Key objectives of Financial Management are:
â€¢ Establishing and enforcing IT financial controls
â€¢ Ensuring compliance with legal, industry, and corporate standards and procedures
Assisting IT portfolio investment decisions by providing detailed business cases as well as financial input for decision support
â€¢ Effectively predicting and controlling IT budgets
â€¢ Providing the enterprise with operational visibility, insight, and superior decision-making.
The overriding goal of Financial Management is to provide cost effective stewardship of the IT assets and the financial resources used in providing IT services. Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organizationâ€™s customers.
This is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:
â€¢ Hardware and software license costs
â€¢ Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software
â€¢ Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service
â€¢ Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges
â€¢ Taxes, capital or interest charges
â€¢ Compliance costs
â€¢ Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes.

Purpose
â€¢  Provide chargeback or showback for internal and external services taking into account service Subscription and Usage information.
â€¢  Break down chargeback or showback based on charge types such as CapEx/OpEx, direct/indirect, fixed/variable, and labor/non-labor, as well as by consumer or consumer groups.
â€¢  Charge for IT services rendered based on the pricing model associated with the catalog item, this may also be implemented via showback (no actual billing or cross-charging), which helps the consumer become more IT cost-aware.
â€¢  Trace chargeback or showback line items to individual cost drivers based on the cost model.
â€¢  Consolidate IT service Subscription (right to use) and actual Usage as the usage may differ from the right to use.

The Chargeback/Showback functional component:
â€¢  Shall provide the price of consuming/subscribing to a service.
â€¢  Can take actual usage into consideration when calculating the price of consuming a service.
If an IT Financial Management component exists, the Chargeback/Showback functional component:
â€¢  Can provide the necessary information in order for the IT Financial Management supporting function to produce invoices or bills for services rendered.",""
