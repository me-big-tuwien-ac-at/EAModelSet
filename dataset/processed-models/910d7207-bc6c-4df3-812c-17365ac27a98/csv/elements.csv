A card charge is disputed and a case raised - the case processing requests documentation from the merchant and the resolution is aligned to the payoff ranges governing the agreement

General comment:

This candidate service domain is a place holder for a potentially complex array of service domain capabilities needed to manage interbank, merchant relationships and financial capture networks needed to fully support a card product. This is a specialized activity typically outsourced by most banks and so is currently modeled as a 'gateway' relationship rather than a complete range of service domains. In addition to the merchant agreement that determines the transactional fees/terms and rules for dispute resolution, the merchant relationship needs to handle their side of disputes, operation of the merchant network and distributed facilities and some aspects of card inventory management. Note: the internal working of the merchant and financial capture network is not covered in the current release of the BIAN model

Business Purpose
:  Administer the day to day interactions with merchants, in particular for coordination of case resolution

An external prospect list is acquired for a segment targeted by a proposed prospect campaign. It's subjects are compared against known customers to eliminate duplications prior to initiating the campaign. The prospect execution team use prospect management to capture the state of prospects and once a prospect details have been verified and the prospect has expressed sufficient interest/commitment the offer management process is initiated. Note that for different customer types (non consumer in particular) and for some offered products and services there may need to be actions performed to establish the individual as a customer prior to product/service offer processing

General comment:

This service domain tracks the state of an identified prospect - defined to be an individual or organization that has been provisionally matched to a product and/or service, who may have indicated an interest but that has yet to agree terms and/or be authorized/accepted as a 'customer'. Typically they will be the target of a prospect campaign or other more general sales effort/response activities. Prospects can be sourced externally (through the acquisition of commercial prospect lists and general market research), can be generated from advertizing campaigns where contact is solicited and there can also be also unsolicited contacts (""walk-ins""). The service domain supports other service domains as they orchestrate the transition of a prospect to being a customer that can then be the subject of a formal offer process. (Note that he term prospect can be applied to an existing customer for which there is the potential to sell additional products and services but at this time Prospect Management is specifically used to handle non-customer prospects.) Once a prospect has been verified and has also indicated an interest they can be classified as a 'customer' and offer management initiated. This definition enables the offer management process to be the same for existing and new customers, but also introduces an anomalous type of customer - the one that is accepted from being a prospect but that for some reason fails to complete the offer process - the approach is a compromise that anticipates that once an offer process has been initiated that there are some legal obligations on either party and so it is best to classify them as a customer for which there is no active business.

Business Purpose
:  Capture, classify and track prospects to the point of initiating an offer for a suitably qualified prospect. Prospects can be sourced in a number of ways including the acquisition of prospect lists from 3rd parties, general market research and solicited by brand and advertizing activity. Prospect details are scrubbed and matched/checked against known customers to eliminate duplicates. Prospects can be tracked individually, by grouping criteria and by 'list'. Prospect Management handles the verification of the prospect, initiating the offer management process for suitably qualified prospects









Пример использования:

Как правило, они будут целью кампании потенциальных клиентов или других более общих мероприятий по продажам/ответных действий. Перспективы могут быть получены извне (путем приобретения коммерческих списков перспектив и общего исследования рынка), могут быть получены из рекламных кампаний, где запрашивается контакт, а также могут быть также незапрошенные контакты (""прогулки""). Домен обслуживания поддерживает другие домены обслуживания, поскольку они управляют переходом потенциального клиента, который затем может быть предметом формального процесса предложения.
