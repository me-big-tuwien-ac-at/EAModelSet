The EIRA has been developed in the context of Action 2.1 of the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) Programme. The EIRA is a reference architecture focused on the interoperability of digital public services. It is composed of the most important architecture building blocks needed to promote cross-border and cross-sector interactions between public administrations. It is based on the Service Oriented Architecture style and uses ArchiMate as a modelling notation. The EIRA implements the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) .
