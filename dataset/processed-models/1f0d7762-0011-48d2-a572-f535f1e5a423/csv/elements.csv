## About Enterprise Architecture within Government of Canada

Enterprise Architecture in its current form within the Government of Canada is heavily focused on the Management of IM/IT, however its principles can be found across all viewpoints of the organization within the Architecture Development Model (ADM) including Business, Information and systems, as well as technology.

The [Government of Canada Strategic Plan for Information Management and Information Technology 2017 to 2021](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology/strategic-plan-2017-2021.html#toc8-2-2) states, ""Sound IM-IT management starts with consistent planning based on documented descriptions of the enterprise. With an understanding of what is in play, managers can adopt solutions that best address their business needs while advancing government-wide architecture.""

[Directive on Management of Information Technology](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249), provides guidance on how to assess Enterprise Architecture through Appendix C - Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment.",""

The MAF is a key tool of oversight that is used by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) to help ensure that federal departments and agencies are well managed, accountable and that resources are allocated to achieve results. It also ensures that Treasury Board Policy Suite requirements and expected results are met.
Objectives

The Management Accountability Framework establishes the expectations for sound public sector management practices and performance. The MAF supports the management accountability of organizational deputy heads and improves management practices across government departments and agencies.

The objectives of the MAF are:

    To inform the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat about the state of policy implementation and practices;
    To support the management accountability of Deputy Ministers and Heads of Agencies by providing information about their organizations’ management capacity;
    To communicate and track progress on government-wide management priorities;
    To obtain an organizational and government-wide view of the state of management practices and performance in order to identify areas of management strength and any areas that require attention; and;
    To continuously improve management capabilities, effectiveness and efficiency government-wide.

Framework

MAF is a framework for a well-managed organization. It sets out the conditions that are required to achieve strong organizational performance.
Elements of the Framework: A description of the graphic can be found at the link located below
Framework - Text version

In order to achieve management excellence, each element of the framework needs to have been considered and put into place.
MAF assessment process

The Management Accountability (MAF) assessment process involves a review of management practices and performance in small and large departments and agencies across the federal government on an annual basis.
MAF area of management methodologies

Each area of management (AoM) has a methodology which sets out the assessment criteria for the department or agency being assessed.
MAF government-wide results

At the end of the MAF cycle, a government-wide report is issued that provides a broader perspective on the MAF results. This report summarizes the state of management practices and performance government-wide for each area of management assessed.",""

Preamble

Recognizing that

the public service has contributed to the building of Canada, and will continue to do so in the future while delivering services of highest quality to the public;

Canada will continue to benefit from a public service that is based on merit and non-partisanship and in which these values are independently safeguarded;

Canada will also continue to gain from a public service that strives for excellence, that is representative of Canada’s diversity and that is able to serve the public with integrity and in their official language of choice;

the public service, whose members are drawn from across the country, reflects a myriad of backgrounds, skills and professions that are a unique resource for Canada;

authority to make appointments to and within the public service has been vested in the Public Service Commission, which can delegate this authority to deputy heads;

those to whom this appointment authority is delegated must exercise it within a framework that ensures that they are accountable for its proper use to the Commission, which in turn is accountable to Parliament;

delegation of staffing authority should be to as low a level as possible within the public service, and should afford public service managers the flexibility necessary to staff, to manage and to lead their personnel to achieve results for Canadians; and

the Government of Canada is committed to a public service that embodies linguistic duality and that is characterized by fair, transparent employment practices, respect for employees, effective dialogue, and recourse aimed at resolving appointment issues;

NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:",""

The Treasury Board Policy Suite is the collection of mandatory policy instruments which contain rules for management in the federal public service. The policy instruments are approved by the Treasury Board and administered by the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS).

Treasury Board policy instruments include policies and directives that contain mandatory requirements. Each requirement tells a responsible official to undertake a specific activity or task that collectively supports the instrument’s objectives and expected results.

Treasury Board policies aim to ensure that government resources are effectively managed, while demonstrating care and good judgement, and to manage significant risks to the operations of government. The policies also support public sector values, including respect for Parliament, people, integrity and stewardship, as well as other management values such as sound governance, transparency and value for money.

The Treasury Board has the authority to create mandatory policies through various pieces of legislation, including:

    Financial Administration Act (sections 7, 9, 10, 11)
    Access to Information Act (section 70)
    Canada Labour Code (section 124 and 125)
    Public Service Employment Act (sections 26, 51, 61, 62)
    Privacy Act (section 71)
    Official Languages Act (section 46)
    Surplus Crown Assets Act (section 3)
    Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act (section 16)

One of the key oversight tools for measuring compliance with the requirements of the policy suite is the Management Accountability Framework (MAF) which is used by TBS to monitor how federal departments are meeting expected results.
