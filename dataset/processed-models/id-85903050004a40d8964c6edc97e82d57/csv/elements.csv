It mirrors the XML-based meta-data harnessed in the Catalogue Server, but using Semantic Web standards such as DCAT, Dublin Core, VCard or PROV. This meta-data is augmented with links to domain web ontologies, in particular GloSIS. This semantically augmented meta-data is the main pilar of knowledge extraction activities and components.

The Large Language Model foreseen in this project will be trained on this knowledge graph, thus forming the basis for the Chatbot component of the user interface. The knowledge graph will further feed the facilites for machine-based access to the SWR: a knowledge extration API and a SPARQL end-point.
