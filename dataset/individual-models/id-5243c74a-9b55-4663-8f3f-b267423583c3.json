An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,\nOften accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.\nA commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements.

A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly wel assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time.

the Banks Strategic Goals. \nBIAN's Business Capability Model is a general accepted reference model of business capabilities that are needed to make a bank a bank. The Organization specific Banking Business Capability model will support the Banking Strategy.\nA Banking Strategy is, amongst others, supported by an Information System Strategy. Often the principles of no-redundancy of data and functionality is expressed.\nThe Information System Strategy type that BIAN proposes is to decompose the Bank into a number of Mutual Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) Service Domains. \nThese Service Domains are banking capabilities from the structuring perspective of the Information System Strategy. This terminology creates confusion. So BIAN will use the word \"Capability\" to refer to the \"Business Capability\" and use the word \"Capacity\" when talking about a \"Service Domain\".\nWhen defining a Service Domain, subject matter experts deliver a number of Business Scenario's . A business Scenario is an interaction between multiple service operations that together realize the objective of the scenario. A business scenario is actually realizing a business service. The interaction between the service operations is expressed by sending and receiving messages to and from service operations. These messages contain data about business objects and bring this data in a specific context so that the message get meaning for the service operation. All the Service Operation interactions expressed by the incoming and outgoing messages represent the life-cycle information about an instance of an Asset Type. The type of information to capture the life-cycle data of an instance of an asset is called a \"Control Record\". A Control record captures all the life-cycle data of an Asset Type. An Asset Type is a classification of a composition of one or more business objects, together having value for the business. \nEach component of the Asset Type has information that can be expressed in a so called \"Behavior Qualifier\", which is in itself an expression information about business objects in context.  All information expressing information about objects in context belong to the Business Information Layer. The business objects independent from functional context are defined in the Business Object layer. \n\nThe Business Object Layer will be the foundation for an Enterprise Wide Information Model. \nThe Business Information Layer will carry information that is derived from Business Object characteristics and their relationships. The Control Record, Analytical Objects, Behavior Qualifiers, Asset-Types, Messages, Business Documents, Reports, Balanced Score Cards, Dash Boards, etc. belong to this layer. Information is the life blood of the running enterprise. So information will support the dynamics of the Bank , which is expressed at the behavior layer. To this layer belong the conepts of Business Scenario's, Banking Business Capabilities and Service Domains."}]}
