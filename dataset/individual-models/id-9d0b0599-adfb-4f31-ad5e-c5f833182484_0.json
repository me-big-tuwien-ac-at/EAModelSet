A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.[4]\r\n\r\nThe language was first conceived by Alain Colmerauer and his group in Marseille, France, in the early 1970s and the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel.[5][6]\r\n\r\nProlog was one of the first logic programming languages,[7] and remains the most popular among such languages today, with several free and commercial implementations available. The language has been used for theorem proving,[8] expert systems,[9] term rewriting,[10] type systems,[11] and automated planning,[12] as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing.[13][14] Modern Prolog environments support the creation of graphical user interfaces, as well as administrative and networked applications.\r\n\r\nProlog is well-suited for specific tasks that benefit from rule-based logical queries such as searching databases, voice control systems, and filling templates."},{"id":"c5db6439-fabf-47a0-82e9-066e27e8af63","name":"RDF4J 3.0.3","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"https://rdf4j.org/\r\nEclipse rdf4j is a powerful Java framework for processing and handling RDF data.

This document defines an abstract syntax (a data model) which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications. The abstract syntax has two key data structures: RDF graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples, where the elements may be IRIs, blank nodes, or datatyped literals. They are used to express descriptions of resources. RDF datasets are used to organize collections of RDF graphs, and comprise a default graph and zero or more named graphs. RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax also introduces key concepts and terminology, and discusses datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within RDF graphs.\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer\n\r\nThe Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for expressing information about resources. Resources can be anything, including documents, people, physical objects, and abstract concepts.\r\n\r\nRDF is intended for situations in which information on the Web needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning. Since it is a common framework, application designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and processing tools. The ability to exchange information between different applications means that the information may be made available to applications other than those for which it was originally created.\r\n\r\nIn particular RDF can be used to publish and interlink data on the Web. For example, retrieving http://www.example.org/bob#me could provide data about Bob, including the fact that he knows Alice, as identified by her IRI (an IRI is an \"International Resource Identifier\"; see Sec. 3.2 for details). Retrieving Alice's IRI could then provide more data about her, including links to other datasets for her friends, interests, etc. A person or an automated process can then follow such links and aggregate data about these various things. Such uses of RDF are often qualified as Linked Data [LINKED-DATA]."},{"id":"e82bca78-43d0-4aba-b703-66a999cab28a","name":"IEC 62714","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-5f6668c7a0d74fc88c2c8a0f191f2bb7","name":"Node CSV 5.3.2","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"https://csv.js.org/\nhttps://github.com/adaltas/node-csv"},{"id":"a24674a7-a6a3-466f-9329-5e7ccf88cc4a","name":"SocioViz","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"SocioViz: a social media analytics platform powered by Social Network Analysis metrics.

RethinkDB’s realtime push architecture dramatically reduces the time and effort necessary to build scalable realtime apps.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being designed from the ground up for realtime apps, RethinkDB offers a flexible query language, intuitive operations and monitoring APIs, and is easy to setup and learn.\r\n\r\nSee the post Advancing the realtime web for more technical details on RethinkDB’s mission.\r\nWhen is RethinkDB a good choice?\r\nhttps://rethinkdb.com/faq\r\nRethinkDB is a great choice when your applications could benefit from realtime feeds to your data.\r\nThe query-response database access model works well on the web because it maps directly to HTTP’s request-response.

The proposal extends the set of OWL axioms to include Horn-like rules. It thus enables Horn-like rules to be combined with an OWL knowledge base. A high-level abstract syntax is provided that extends the OWL abstract syntax described in the OWL Semantics and Abstract Syntax document [OWL S&AS]. An extension of the OWL model-theoretic semantics is also given to provide a formal meaning for OWL ontologies including rules written in this abstract syntax.\r\n\r\nThe proposed rules are of the form of an implication between an antecedent (body) and consequent (head). The intended meaning can be read as: whenever the conditions specified in the antecedent hold, then the conditions specified in the consequent must also hold.\r\n\r\nBoth the antecedent (body) and consequent (head) consist of zero or more atoms. An empty antecedent is treated as trivially true (i.e. satisfied by every interpretation), so the consequent must also be satisfied by every interpretation; an empty consequent is treated as trivially false (i.e., not satisfied by any interpretation), so the antecedent must also not be satisfied by any interpretation. Multiple atoms are treated as a conjunction. Note that rules with conjunctive consequents could easily be transformed (via the Lloyd-Topor transformations [Lloyd87]) into multiple rules each with an atomic consequent.\r\n\r\nAtoms in these rules can be of the form C(x), P(x,y), sameAs(x,y) or differentFrom(x,y), where C is an OWL description, P is an OWL property, and x,y are either variables, OWL individuals or OWL data values. It is easy to see that OWL DL becomes undecidable when extended in this way as rules can be used to simulate role value maps [Schmidt-Schauß89].\r\n\r\nAn XML syntax is also given for these rules based on RuleML and the OWL XML presentation syntax. Furthermore, an RDF concrete syntax based on the OWL RDF/XML exchange syntax is presented. The rule syntaxes are illustrated with several running examples. Finally, we give usage suggestions and cautions."},{"id":"id-4453364a-fec5-4116-be4b-3605817e049f","name":"Organization C","type":"BusinessActor","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-4eb7aad3ab09486c9e20a92d0a13d0f2","name":"RxApacheHttp","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-4a57d2af90c3466098b12c122e49bc86","name":"AdaptNLP","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"https://github.com/Novetta/adaptnlp\nA high level framework and library for running, training, and deploying state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for end to end tasks.\nAdaptNLP allows users ranging from beginner python coders to experienced machine learning engineers to leverage state-of-the-art NLP models and training techniques in one easy-to-use python package.\n\nBuilt atop Zalando Research's Flair and Hugging Face's Transformers library, AdaptNLP provides Machine Learning Researchers and Scientists a modular and adaptive approach to a variety of NLP tasks with an Easy API for training, inference, and deploying NLP-based microservices."},{"id":"id-5584b0fe3cee4fe4b0fc961fa21c7175","name":".NET Async Programming in a Nutshell","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":"https://medium.com/@nelsonparente/net-async-programming-in-a-nutshell-dc01c2e71a20"},{"id":"id-0b1a7c12-a0e6-425a-856f-ced0bc9b871d","name":"Gremlin-Python","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-python\nApache TinkerPop’s Gremlin-Python implements Gremlin within the Python language and can be used on any Python virtual machine including the popular CPython machine.

The deliverable of the project is a data exchange format for military Enterprise Architectures. The scope is four nation (plus NATO as observers) and covers MODAF (UK), DoDAF (USA), DNDAF (Canada) and the Australian Defence Architecture Framework (AUSDAF). The initial scope for exchange is the architectural data required to support coalition operations planning -\n\nSystems - communications systems, networks, software applications, etc.\nCommunications links between systems\nInformation specifications - the types of information (and their security classifications) that the comms architecture will handle\nPlatforms & facilities.\nSystem & operational functions (activities)\nPeople & organizations\nArchitecture meta-data - who owns it, who was the architect, name, version, description, etc.\n\nThe work has begun with the development of a formal ontology to specify the data exchange semantics. The W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) will be the format used for data exchange. A demonstration of multinational interoperability is scheduled for September 2007, based on exchanging process models for casualty tracking.\n\nDEAS is a formal, higher-order, 4D (see four dimensionalism) ontology. It is extensional (see Extension (metaphysics)), using physical existence as its criterion for identity. In practical terms, this means the ontology is well suited to managing change over time and identifying elements with a degree of precision that is not possible using names alone.\n\nThe ontology is being built using the BORO Method which has proven useful for the multi-disciplinary team working on IDEAS. BORO forces the ontology developer to consider each concept in terms of its physical extent. This means there can be no argument about names or meaning - something either exists or it doesn't. The BORO Method also deals with classes and relationships by tracing them back to their members (classes) or ends (relationships)."},{"id":"id-3e8015be-0931-4486-8f1e-1486b06f5b08","name":"JSON LD Specifications","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-187835228ced4660a8970f71bd6a7dca","name":"ModelFoundry 1.1.1","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"c8501d87-e2dc-45be-8dd9-8bc3c34dedf7","name":"JSONEditor Online","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"ec30b13e-9477-4850-862b-6ec9a17afdec","name":"Representation","type":"Representation","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-751e307088b94878bc600a41b2dd1599","name":"Enterprise Architect 15.2","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-6773dadf-0d45-4d77-86fc-a3f2fd61dfd5","name":"Enteprise Model of Reference","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-4d41752ca4a9405da7863af0870a278e","name":"Business Actor","type":"BusinessActor","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-6649d0b9b2084f2a8e5a0873772101ef","name":"Wink.js","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"Github: https://github.com/winkjs/wink-nlp-utils\n\nWink provides NLP functions for amplifying negations, managing elisions, creating ngrams, stems, phonetic codes to tokens, and more."},{"id":"id-52b81a1e-6010-4e1c-909b-463319c6c49d","name":"Organization D","type":"BusinessActor","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-23472d35-e670-4d85-a846-d5955bed6138","name":"Skeemas","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-091c84b10651471bbcbb8f14724cf91b","name":"RxScala","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-45a3b629-ce58-4687-bb4b-f73c97eb90a4","name":"CodePlex","type":"BusinessActor","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-364378c4891e4130b65748195b98c065","name":"SAP Netweaber BPM","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-22ae49c4-b83e-4039-afdd-bc7fb4ba960b","name":"gremlin-template-string","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"https://github.com/jbmusso/gremlin-template-string\nGenerate Gremlin scripts with bound parameters using ES6 template strings.\n\nGremlin is a graph database query language used by the Apache TinkerPop framework."},{"id":"id-3bf3055bf12e4d4eab5a69ae8a8c50b0","name":"API Management Solution","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"c4bd152f-2216-41c4-b5f6-fe388eb43c91","name":"COMAN","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"Description: COMAN is a software solution for layout based digital site management to accelerate project execution.

Querying is performed through the language: Graql, a declarative, knowledge-oriented graph query language for retrieving explicitly stored and implicitly derived information, as well as to perform graph analytics and automated reasoning. \r\n\r\nGrakn allows you to model your domain using the well-known Entity-Relationship model at its full expressivity. It is composed of entity types, relationship types, and attribute types. Unlike other modelling languages, Grakn allows you to define type hierarchies, hyper-entities, hyper-relations, and rules to build rich knowledge models.\r\n\r\nGrakn allows you to define rules in your knowledge schema, which extends the expressivity of your model as it enables the system to derive new conclusions when a certain logical form in your dataset is satisfied. Like functions in programming, that rules can chain itself to another, creating abstractions of behaviour at the data level.\r\n\r\nGrakn's inference facility translates one query into all of its other interpretations. This happens through two mechanisms: type-based and rule-based inference.\r\nNot only does this derive new conclusions and uncovers relationships that would otherwise be hidden, but it also enables the abstraction of complex patterns into simple queries.\r\n\r\nAnalytics: Distributed analytics is a set of scalable algorithms that allows you to perform computation over large amounts of data in a distributed fashion. They tend to belong to the family of MapReduce or Pregel algorithms (BSP). Often, this requires the implementation of challenging algorithms.

Together, the aforementioned graph is known as a property graph and it is the foundational data structure of Apache TinkerPop. \r\n\r\nIf a user's domain is composed of a heterogeneous set of objects (vertices) that can be related to one another in a multitude of ways (edges), then a graph may be the right representation to use. In a graph, each vertex is seen as an atomic entity (not simply a \"row in a table\") that can be linked to any other vertex or have properties added or removed at will. This empowers the data modeler to think in terms of actors within a world of complex relations as opposed to, in relational databases, statically-typed tables joined in aggregate. Once a domain is modeled, that model must then be exploited in order to yield novel, differentiating information. Graph computing has a rich history that includes not only query languages devoid of table-join semantics, but also algorithms that support complex reasoning: path analysis, vertex clustering and ranking, subgraph identification, and more. The world of applied graph computing offers a flexible, intuitive data structure along with a host of algorithms able to effectively leverage that structure.\r\n\r\nApache TinkerPop™ is an open source, vendor-agnostic, graph computing framework distributed under the commercial friendly Apache2 license. When a data system is TinkerPop-enabled, its users are able to model their domain as a graph and analyze that graph using the Gremlin graph traversal language. Furthermore, all TinkerPop-enabled systems integrate with one another allowing them to easily expand their offerings as well as allowing users to choose the appropriate graph technology for their application. Sometimes an application is best served by an in-memory, transactional graph database. Sometimes a multi-machine distributed graph database will do the job. Or perhaps the application requires both a distributed graph database for real-time queries and, in parallel, a Big(Graph)Data processor for batch analytics. Whatever the application's requirements, there exists a TinkerPop-enabled graph system out there to meet its needs."},{"id":"id-31538372cd3e47fca8fbbeafec5d2098","name":"Yaoqiang BPMN Editor 4.0","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-832c6e24-2503-4cb1-85d9-54d713d24965","name":"myProject myApplication User","type":"BusinessActor","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-a3d1a8fdeb6544cbae192012de9d56a2","name":"RabbitMQ","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-4b6c4b85769b40d692d12ae4787e030a","name":"Business Process","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"a653a642-511a-4ec0-9c98-da7fe1b97598","name":"IDA System","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"Description: The IDA System evolved from the project \"Interoperable Semantic Data Fusion for automated generation of view-based process control visualization\" (briefly: IDA) which deals with the interoperability of process visualization as an interface between man and machine.

Chris’ initial patents for MarkLogic focused on storing and searching unstructured XML data, and later patents spanned into multi-model capabilities.\n\nMarkLogic quickly gained prominence as large enterprises faced the challenges of integrating large volumes and varieties data. But, those large enterprises also needed enterprise features. For that reason, MarkLogic’s early product releases were designed with features such as ACID transactions and granular security.\n\nIn 2012, Gary Bloom joined MarkLogic as the CEO. Gary was an early employee at Oracle, and led Oracle’s database division through their most significant period of growth in the early 1990’s. Other executives joined MarkLogic to help with product development, bringing experience from Microsoft, Symantec, and other successful enterprise tech companies.\n\nToday, MarkLogic has an impressive list of over 2,500 customers spanning the globe and a dozen offices in the U.S. Europe, and Asia-Pacific.\n\nAs the company has grown, one thing never changed—the vision is still to enable organizations to get more value from their data faster.

Combine tasks, deadlines, time management, business rules, and notifications without writing a single line of code. Deploying and running your processes in minutes/hours (instead of weeks/months) is a key benefit of your cloud BPM.\n\nCustomize the form\nDefine the form that needs to be completed at each step of the process with an amazing Form Builder. Multiple field types and visibility options can be combined to meet every possible need. Default values, auto-populated content, functions, and scripts to save valuable time and avoid mistakes. Arrange your fields using a grid layout and sections. A well-designed form is key to accomplish an intuitive and flexible cloud workflow.\n\nExecute the process\nA key feature of your cloud BPM is that assignees will receive pending tasks on their Inbox in their PC or mobile. As the process instance moves along the workflow, each task will be assigned to a user or role automatically. Each task will display fields, attachments, and comments. Use filters and searches to quickly find what you need and identify which tasks are more urgent. Reassign tasks when needed and check the audit trail for changes.\n\nMeasure and Analyze\nStatistics are key in your cloud BPM initiative. They will show you how your processes are doing: What tasks are currently delayed? Which users/roles have more tasks assigned? Historical data will help you make better decisions: the number of processes launched, how many were completed and which tasks are more time-consuming. Custom Reports let you focus on what matters the most to you and your team. Share them with whoever you want or schedule to send via email (e.g. every week) increasing your cloud workflow efficiency."},{"id":"id-873419df-a2e2-4506-a84a-7166b173b47d","name":"Onodo","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"Onodo: an open-source network visualization and analysis tool for non-tech users.

In particular, this profile contains the intersection of RDFS and OWL 2 DL. It is designed so that data (assertions) that is stored in a standard relational database system can be queried through an ontology via a simple rewriting mechanism, i.e., by rewriting the query into an SQL query that is then answered by the RDBMS system, without any changes to the data.\r\n\r\nOWL 2 QL is based on the DL-Lite family of description logics [DL-Lite]. Several variants of DL-Lite have been described in the literature, and DL-LiteR provides the logical underpinning for OWL 2 QL. DL-LiteR does not require the unique name assumption (UNA), since making this assumption would have no impact on the semantic consequences of a DL-LiteR ontology. More expressive variants of DL-Lite, such as DL-LiteA, extend DL-LiteR with functional properties, and these can also be extended with keys; however, for query answering to remain in LOGSPACE, these extensions require UNA and need to impose certain global restrictions on the interaction between properties used in different types of axiom. Basing OWL 2 QL on DL-LiteR avoids practical problems involved in the explicit axiomatization of UNA. Other variants of DL-Lite can also be supported on top of OWL 2 QL, but may require additional restrictions on the structure of ontologies."},{"id":"id-8efbf345-8b8f-4062-9f90-b87df230b377","name":"Business Function","type":"BusinessFunction","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"b548672c-6e2a-457c-b2a2-85bfea145e8b","name":"ArchiMate model over OWL2","type":"Representation","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-7b09724e-01ce-4f6c-b45e-3af52ab833a5","name":"Spring Data Gremlin","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"https://github.com/Microsoft/spring-data-gremlin\n\nSpring Data Gremlin provides initial Spring Data support for those databases using Gremlin query language.

It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas."},{"id":"cb4a0af1-9eaa-4dc4-a5bb-24e52af81372","name":"Lucene","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-6dcc746c-fc3f-40fd-90ce-08d5cc3aba8b","name":"Liferay 7","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-d6eaa9c3edb5440397dda10eee8d620c","name":"SheetJS js-xlsx V0.16.7","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":"https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs"},{"id":"id-ca09ce0c90394ffabec9b3f700c5c156","name":"Work Relay","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-c5421390a53d4a2685adeb462519e49b","name":"EMC Documentum","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"f28688b1-3c41-4abf-be1b-4a814dc247d9","name":"Organization C","type":"BusinessActor","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-6b320899b8e74a1fb67558b205db019e","name":"Model Driven Software Development","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-5ceec77d-02e9-4967-bc08-726a0d37a352","name":"Business Event","type":"BusinessEvent","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-37065973-1fed-414c-990e-272c0d5defe5","name":"MongoDB","type":"Product","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-60c038ab1a73404e883cd12a6ad56d7d","name":"Information and Data","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":"Representations (descriptions) of things of interest and necessary for the conduct of activities.

You can also use a VPN gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway. However, you can create multiple connections to the same VPN gateway. When you create multiple connections to the same VPN gateway, all VPN tunnels share the available gateway bandwidth.\n\nWhat is a virtual network gateway?\nA virtual network gateway is composed of two or more VMs that are deployed to a specific subnet you create called the gateway subnet. Virtual network gateway VMs contain routing tables and run specific gateway services. These VMs are created when you create the virtual network gateway. You can't directly configure the VMs that are part of the virtual network gateway.\nOne setting that you configure for a virtual network gateway is the gateway type. Gateway type specifies how the virtual network gateway will be used and the actions that the gateway takes. The gateway type 'Vpn' specifies that the type of virtual network gateway created is a 'VPN gateway', rather than an ExpressRoute gateway. A virtual network can have two virtual network gateways; one VPN gateway and one ExpressRoute gateway - as is the case with coexisting connection configurations. For more information, see Gateway types.\nVPN gateways can be deployed in Azure Availability Zones. This brings resiliency, scalability, and higher availability to virtual network gateways. Deploying gateways in Azure Availability Zones physically and logically separates gateways within a region, while protecting your on-premises network connectivity to Azure from zone-level failures. see About zone-redundant virtual network gateways in Azure Availability Zones\nCreating a virtual network gateway can take up to 45 minutes to complete. When you create a virtual network gateway, gateway VMs are deployed to the gateway subnet and configured with the settings that you specify. After you create a VPN gateway, you can create an IPsec/IKE VPN tunnel connection between that VPN gateway and another VPN gateway (VNet-to-VNet), or create a cross-premises IPsec/IKE VPN tunnel connection between the VPN gateway and an on-premises VPN device (Site-to-Site). You can also create a Point-to-Site VPN connection (VPN over OpenVPN, IKEv2, or SSTP), which lets you connect to your virtual network from a remote location, such as from a conference or from home."},{"id":"f9b1057c-e404-4cd5-864e-06b3d2d0b71b","name":"AzureFrontDoorService","type":"TechnologyService","layer":"technology","documentation":"Azure Front Door\nScalable and secure entry point for fast delivery of your global applications\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/frontdoor/\nSSL offload and application acceleration at the edge close to end users\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS Protection\nGlobal HTTP load balancing with instant failover\nCentral control plane for traffic orchestration\nActionable insights about your users and back ends\n\n\nGlobally distributed microservice applications\nEasily join your distributed microservice architectures into a single global application using HTTP load balancing and path-based routing rules.

Rather than process your data in the cloud, IoT Edge processes it on the device itself, with the option of using hardware architecture from Microsoft called Project Brainwave. It uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to make real-time AI calculations, giving you the immediate insights you need to make critical business decisions.\n\nLearn more about Project Brainwave\nReduce IoT solution costs\n\nOnly a small fraction of IoT edge data acquired is meaningful post-analytics. Use services such as Azure Stream Analytics or cloud-trained machine learning models to process the data locally and send only what’s needed to the cloud for further analysis. This reduces the cost associated with sending all your data to the cloud while maintaining high data quality.\n\nGet started with Azure Stream Analytics on IoT Edge\nOperate offline or with intermittent connectivity\n\nOperate your edge devices reliably and securely, even when they’re offline or they have intermittent connectivity to the cloud.

Use it to monitor your live applications. It will automatically detect performance anomalies, and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand what users actually do with your app. It's designed to help you continuously improve performance and usability. It works for apps on a wide variety of platforms including .NET, Node.js, Java, and Python hosted on-premises, hybrid, or any public cloud. It integrates with your DevOps process, and has connection points to a variety of development tools. It can monitor and analyze telemetry from mobile apps by integrating with Visual Studio App Center.\n\nHow does Application Insights work?\nYou install a small instrumentation package (SDK) in your application or enable Application Insights codelessly when supported. The instrumentation monitors your app and directs the telemetry data to an Azure Application Insights Resource using a unique GUID that we refer to as an Instrumentation Key.\nYou can instrument not only the web service application, but also any background components, and the JavaScript in the web pages themselves. The application and its components can run anywhere - it doesn't have to be hosted in Azure.\nIn addition, you can pull in telemetry from the host environments such as performance counters, Azure diagnostics, or Docker logs. You can also set up web tests that periodically send synthetic requests to your web service.\nAll these telemetry streams are integrated into Azure Monitor. In the Azure portal, you can apply powerful analytic and search tools to the raw data.\nWhat's the overhead?\n\nThe impact on your app's performance is very small. Tracking calls are non-blocking, and are batched and sent in a separate thread.\nWhat does Application Insights monitor?\nApplication Insights is aimed at the development team, to help you understand how your app is performing and how it's being used. It monitors:\nRequest rates, response times, and failure rates - Find out which pages are most popular, at what times of day, and where your users are. See which pages perform best. If your response times and failure rates go high when there are more requests, then perhaps you have a resourcing problem.\nDependency rates, response times, and failure rates - Find out whether external services are slowing you down.\nExceptions - Analyze the aggregated statistics, or pick specific instances and drill into the stack trace and related requests. Both server and browser exceptions are reported.\nPage views and load performance - reported by your users' browsers.\nAJAX calls from web pages - rates, response times, and failure rates.\nUser and session counts.\nPerformance counters from your Windows or Linux server machines, such as CPU, memory, and network usage.\nHost diagnostics from Docker or Azure.\nDiagnostic trace logs from your app - so that you can correlate trace events with requests.\nCustom events and metrics that you write yourself in the client or server code, to track business events such as items sold or games won.\n\nWhere do I see my telemetry?\nThere are plenty of ways to explore your data. Check out these articles:\nSmart detection and manual alerts\nSet up automatic alerts that adapt to your app's normal patterns of telemetry and trigger when there's something outside the usual pattern. You can also set alerts on particular levels of custom or standard metrics.\tAlert sample\nApplication map\nExplore the components of your app, with key metrics and alerts.\tApplication map\nProfiler\nInspect the execution profiles of sampled requests.\tProfiler\nUsage analysis\nAnalyze user segmentation and retention.\tRetention tool\nDiagnostic search for instance data\nSearch and filter events such as requests, exceptions, dependency calls, log traces, and page views.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview\nhttps://dev.applicationinsights.io"},{"id":"id-97ca83c0-1e08-43be-9687-b8bdedfe96b4","name":"AzureQueueStorage","type":"TechnologyService","layer":"technology","documentation":"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/queues/\n\nQueue Storage\nDurable queues for large-volume cloud services\n\nSimple, cost-effective, durable message queueing for large workloads\nRich client libraries for .NET, Java, Android, C++, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, and Python\nData accessible via the REST API\n\nDecouple components\nUse Azure Queue Storage to build flexible applications and separate functions for better durability across large workloads.

For compute, Cloud Services, Linux Virtual Machines, or Windows Virtual Machines can be utilized by Batch. The standard rates for compute apply and can be viewed below; software licensing costs for batch graphics and rendering are available below.\n\nLow-priority VMs\nLow-priority VMs can significantly reduce the costs of running certain workloads or allow much more work to be performed at a greater scale for the same cost. However, these VMs do have different characteristics and are only suitable for certain types of applications and workloads. The VMs are allocated from surplus capacity and therefore availability varies—at times, VMs may not be available to allocate, and allocated VMs may be preempted. The availability SLA for pay-as-you-go VMs therefore does not apply to spot and low-priority VMs.\n\nIf applications can tolerate interruption, then use of low-priority VMs can significantly lower compute costs. Suitable workloads include batch processing and HPC jobs, where the work is split into many asynchronous tasks. If VMs are pre-empted, then tasks can be interrupted and rerun—job completion time can also increase if capacity drops. Azure Batch pools can contain both normal and low-priority VMs. If low-priority VMs are pre-empted, then any interrupted tasks will be requeued, and the pool will automatically attempt to replace the lost capacity.\n\nPricing for low-priority VMs is displayed below. For spot VM pricing, see the pricing page for Virtual Machine Scale Sets.\n\nVirtual machines are billed per-second rounded down to the last minute.\n\nNote: Azure Batch will add support for Spot VMs once Spot VMs is GA, with new versions of the Batch APIs and tools being made available. When support for Spot VMs is added, low-priority VMs will be deprecated, but it will be possible to use them for at least a year using the existing API and tool versions.\n\nAv2 Standard *\nAv2 Standard is the latest generation of A-series virtual machines with similar CPU performance and faster disk. These virtual machines are suitable for development workloads, build servers, code repositories, low-traffic websites and web applications, micro services, early product experiments, and small databases. Like the prior A Standard generation, Av2 virtual machines will include load balancing and auto-scaling at no additional charge.\n\nD2a – D96a v4\nThe Da v4-series VMs are based on the 2.35Ghz AMD EPYCTM 7452 processor, which can achieve up to 3.35GHz. The Dav4 VM sizes offer a combination of vCPU(s), memory and temporary storage able to meet the requirements associated with most production workloads. Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use Premium SSD disk storage, select the Das v4 VMs."},{"id":"id-63f4b0ba-0d43-4a89-b264-2375a0c10d59","name":"Apps Configuration","type":"TechnologyService","layer":"technology","documentation":"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-configuration/\nFast, scalable parameter storage for app configuration\nStart free\nProduct overview\nFeatures\nSecurity\nPricing\nGetting started\nFAQs\nFree account \nConfigure, store, and retrieve parameters and settings\nGet hosted, universal storage for all of your Azure apps.

Common use cases include event-based streaming with dynamic ad insertion and live streaming with cloud DVR requirements. Live encoding has been used to power some of the largest events on the planet such as Super Bowl 2015 and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\nScalable cloud encoding with high performance\nQuickly burst your demanding web- or studio-grade encoding workflows through the cloud. Submit your encoding jobs to the cloud for batch processing on our high-performance computers. You control the performance level and the number of concurrent encoding tasks.\nHighly-secure encoding workflows for web developers, broadcasters, and studios\nFrom simple web delivery for HTML5 to complex media decision logic that solves demanding studio workflows, the Media Encoder feature of Azure Media Services allows you to define your own encoding workflows. Use desktop tools, like Azure Media Explorer and our advanced graphical Workflow Designer, to define an encoding workflow that meets your business needs and then execute it at scale.\nPay for what you encode\nTake advantage of the full breadth of our encoding features, but only pay for what you use. Our pricing is based on the duration (minutes) of output, so your bill is easy to understand and calculate, whatever features or encoding options you choose. Scale up and down as your business or workflow demands.\nEncode once and deliver everywhere\nFor smooth content delivery across multiple devices, encode all of your content into standard multiple bitrate MP4 files, and deliver them dynamically to the latest adaptive bitrate streaming protocols. Adaptive bitrate streaming gives your customers a better experience by adjusting video playback to meet the demands of their available bandwidth. This means no more buffered messages and a smooth, professional playback experience from the cloud.\nMultiple format support\nWe provide you with a wide range of support for the most popular input file formats. Our Standard encoder supports a wide range of web delivery formats, and our Premium encoder supports an even wider range of broadcast and studio file formats to meet the demands of the video industry.\nSave money on encoding and storage with dynamic packaging\nBy default, all of our encoding presets create standard MP4 multi-bitrate files, which saves you money on storage and reduces the duplication of encoding costs. You only need to encode and store files in standards-based MP4 file format, and we convert them on the fly into your favorite streaming protocols. Simply add a Streaming Reserved Unit and deliver your files in MPEG-DASH, Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), and Microsoft Smooth Streaming without re-encoding them. To avoid repackaging, you can even add encryption on the fly.\nAdvanced encoding features\nMedia Encoder gives you thumbnail generation, image and audio overlays, sub-clip creation, and multiple-clip stitching. Use the Workflow Designer to build complex encoding presets that can take specified actions based on metadata from the incoming source file or your own custom recipes."},{"id":"b6a9e1ef-5bad-4480-8ccd-c99dfe2e8393","name":"Device","type":"Device","layer":"technology","documentation":""},{"id":"id-3eb5fc39-c492-47db-9975-e39cc917201b","name":"Equipment","type":"Equipment","layer":"technology","documentation":""},{"id":"b9cb97d3-6d21-47be-ace8-3352262fb327","name":"Technology

You only pay for the VMs in your cluster, and any infrastructure resources consumed like storage and networking. This means on Azure, you will pay nothing for the management of your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nAKS is currently available for Linux virtual machines.\n\nCreating an AKS cluster typically takes a few minutes.

UFO-A has been employed to analyze structural conceptual modeling constructs such as object types and taxonomic relations, associations and relations between associations, roles, properties, datatypes and weak entities, and parthood relations among objects. More recent developments incorporate an ontology of events in UFO (UFO-B), as well as an ontology of social and intentional aspects (UFO-C). The combination of UFO-A, B and C has been used to analyze, redesign and integrate reference conceptual models in a number of complex domains such as, for instance, Enterprise Modeling, Software Engineering, Service Science, Petroleum and Gas, Telecommunications, and Bioinformatics. Another recent development aimed towards a clear account of services and service-related concepts, and provided for a commitment-based account of the notion of service (UFO-S),[13] UFO is the foundational ontology for OntoUML, an ontology modeling language."},{"id":"id-7033be68-6016-437d-9d5b-095008d2727e","name":"Grouping","type":"Grouping","layer":"other","documentation":""},{"id":"ac5f8d52-9ac6-4d52-92ad-adb0737f9078","name":"Grouping","type":"Grouping","layer":"other","documentation":""},{"id":"id-308af52a-5ce1-4eda-bee7-e71a86a3ce84","name":"","type":"Grouping","layer":"other","documentation":""},{"id":"id-1a695d34-ca8b-4ead-837c-090664e1dbbf","name":"Chapter 02 -

JavaScript applications outside web browsers. This is not the JavaScript we are familiar with in web browsers! For example, there is no DOM built into Node.js, nor any other browser capability.\nThe network layer of Node.js is low level while being simple to use. For example, the HTTP modules allow you to write an HTTP server (or client) using a few lines of code. This is powerful, but it puts you, the programmer, very close to the protocol requests and makes you implement precisely those HTTP headers that you should return in request responses.\nTypical web application developers don't need to work at a low level of the HTTP or other protocols. Instead, we tend to be more productive, working with higher-level interfaces. For example, PHP coders assume that Apache (or other HTTP servers) is already there providing the HTTP protocol, and that they don't have to implement the HTTP server portion of the stack. By contrast, a Node.js programmer does implement an HTTP server to which their application code is attached.\nTo simplify the situation, the Node.js community has several web application frameworks, such as Express, providing the higher-level interfaces required by typical programmers. You can quickly configure an HTTP server with baked-in capabilities such as sessions, cookies, serving static files, and logging, letting developers focus on their business logic. Other frameworks provide OAuth 2 support, or focus on REST APIs, and so on."},{"id":"id-75021855-bf88-4dc6-ba05-fe91b8e40658","name":"Chapter 01","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"id-028c9788-c1e3-463e-8e4d-0ff6f4130a52","name":"Node.js complete reference guide","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"id-2c161e68-8e3d-4c3f-b39c-ba7a00e2ac49","name":"Tinkerpop and Gremlin without displayed stereotypes (no labels)","viewpoint":"","documentation":"https://s2graph.apache.org\nHigh-performance Distributed Graph Database\nApache S2Graph is a graph database designed to handle transactional graph processing at scale.
