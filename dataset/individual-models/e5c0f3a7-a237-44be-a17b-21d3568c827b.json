See Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software.\r\n\r\nFor cases where sharing modifications is mandatory, see Strong Reciprocal Implications.\r\n\r\nDon’t Fork Open Source Software\r\nWhere possible, use open source software without modification or contribute them back.\r\n\r\nUse configuration and customize the software with modules, plugins or extensions and make those available to the community. See Guide for Publishing Open Source Code.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to copy (fork) open source software and start making changes to the source code. If a literal fork is created, which means taking a copy of the source code and maintaining your own version independently from the original project, be aware it can make future updates and security patches hard to implement. The development team that made the changes will be responsible for maintaining those changes indefinitely unless they are contributed to the upstream version, which is the original project from which the source code was taken.\r\n\r\nTo make changes to open source software, engage with the community and submit changes upstream to ensure that they are supported by future updates. See Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software.\r\n\r\nNote: the term “fork” in the literal sense may be confused with the process of forking (cloning) projects on GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, which is critical to submit changes back to the original project.\r\n\r\nStrong Reciprocal Implications\r\nStrong reciprocal licences consider that software accessed through a network (like the Internet) is distribution and the modified source code must be made available to users. See Guides for Publishing Open Source Code and Contributing to Open Source Software.\r\n\r\nStrong Reciprocal Licences\r\nThe Open Source Initiative approved licenses and the Free Software Foundation free software licences contain the following strong reciprocal licences.\r\n\r\nGNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)\r\nEuropean Union Public License (EUPL)\r\nOpen Software License (OSL)"},{"id":"283315dd-fa65-4f6f-b0bb-013b0599409f","name":"Actively and Fairly Consider Open Source Software","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":"Be aware that open source software is not completely free, so take into account the total cost of ownership (TCO) of migrating, including exit, transition, and support costs.\r\n\r\nBe Aware of Open Core\r\nA solution that is built with open source software but requires the use of closed-source components should not be considered open source software for the purpose of this guide. The open core development model is where vendors open only portions of their software and then surround the remainder with closed-source offerings, as well as the model where a user such as Canada augments already licenced proprietary software with open source software. The “free” open source software versions often referred to as “community” editions are recommended first. See Verify Open Source Software Ownership or Licence.\r\n\r\nSelecting Open Source Software First\r\nThe mandatory procedures for enterprise architecture assessment ( see annex C of the Directive on Management of Information Technology ) require application architecture – for both new technology and upgrade/migration of existing solutions – to prioritize the use of open source software as well as open standards. Doing so maximizes the substitutability and interoperability of software components and opens the door to creating highly flexible solutions. It also helps mitigate the significant risks which arise from lock-in and similar issues.\r\n\r\nSometimes an open source solution meets most user needs but would require additional investment to develop missing functionality (see Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software). In these cases, this investment must be considered by weighing the total cost of ownership against those of other candidate solutions.\r\n\r\nEvaluation\r\nThe same factors applicable to an evaluation of the feature set and maturity of closed-source software also apply to open source software. Additional criteria should be assessed when evaluating open source software:\r\n\r\nUser Community\r\nA strong user community involved in a project provides people to answer questions, test the software, report bugs, suggest improvements and drive forward overall interest in the software. Look at the software’s public code repository and check the project popularity by looking at the number of likes and followers. Check how active the project responds to users by looking at issues and the time between replies.\r\n\r\nDeveloper Community\r\nA strong developer community with a history of releases and continued involvement tends to demonstrate that fixes and improvements to the software will continue into the future. Look at who are the core developers and who is supporting the project and community, such as a non-profit Foundation. Look at when the project got started, the pace of releases and responses to requests to merge code from contributors.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\nUser documentation provides important information to help users install software and use its features. Technical documentation provides requirements and instructions for installation, development, deployment and configuration of the software.\r\n\r\nSecurity Assessments\r\nAlthough OSS code is auditable, this does not necessarily mean it is secure. The quality of the code and the typical response time for patching security-related flaws help indicate the security maturity level of the software.\r\n\r\nAs per any software, you should maintain best practices and have a process in place to list all packages in use as well as their version in order to patch them promptly."},{"id":"e57ffed9-f55e-4295-b2a1-751937a88242","name":"Concept Case","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"8c9e1393-3e08-4fa2-ad38-fc5972f2de42","name":"Contribution to Open Source Software","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":"https://canada-ca.github.io/open-source-logiciel-libre/en/guides/contributing-to-open-source-software.html"},{"id":"5ef71001-343b-4c22-b079-a52d69110da1","name":"Architecture Review Boards","type":"BusinessInterface","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"da2ac53e-f72e-462f-8acb-f18c750523b2","name":"Use of Open Source Software","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":"https://canada-ca.github.io/open-source-logiciel-libre/en/guides/using-open-source-software.html"},{"id":"e4935a5c-ac5b-4848-b819-5900826b2fa4","name":"Developing a solution","type":"BusinessEvent","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"53236950-e7f2-405f-8c76-bf00674700d4","name":"OGD Architecture Review Boards (ARB)","type":"BusinessActor","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"c1c42b44-4801-4435-82d2-c74248616209","name":"Business Actor","type":"BusinessActor","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"d9421c96-81ad-42b0-a7e1-ee2e38cf0d0e","name":"Assessment framework ","type":"BusinessObject","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"4772186d-4a57-46f3-ba7b-c4ab4ac0b0b7","name":"Review Architecture","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"737a343d-0f2f-435b-a407-94c79d4d8b6f","name":"Verify Open Source Software Ownership or Licence","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":"Whenever the Crown is contemplating acquiring software under an open source licence, departments should review the terms and conditions to validate if they can accept and comply with them given their particular business context.\r\n\r\nThe software is usually provided ‘as-is’ meaning the community will not accept liability or provide any financial compensation to the Crown for service interruption, loss of data, or loss of confidentiality.
