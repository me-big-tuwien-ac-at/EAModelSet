In the case where an IT organization is an internal service provider (according to ITIL, these are Type I and Type II organizations), it is not necessary to bill for services. Sometimes such IT organizations only allocate costs. If an IT organization sells its services to external customers (Type III organization) they will, certainly, issue bills for their services and generate income which funds that organization.\n\nCharging for services by an organization with external customers is the only way to get funding for the organization, cover costs and generate revenue.

It includes all function and processes responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging policies and activities.\nKey objectives of Financial Management are:\n• Establishing and enforcing IT financial controls\n• Ensuring compliance with legal, industry, and corporate standards and procedures\nAssisting IT portfolio investment decisions by providing detailed business cases as well as financial input for decision support\n• Effectively predicting and controlling IT budgets\n• Providing the enterprise with operational visibility, insight, and superior decision-making.\nThe overriding goal of Financial Management is to provide cost effective stewardship of the IT assets and the financial resources used in providing IT services. Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organization’s customers.\nThis is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:\n• Hardware and software license costs\n• Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software\n• Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service\n• Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges\n• Taxes, capital or interest charges\n• Compliance costs\n• Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes.\n"},{"id":"b8c6dd55","name":"Business Impact Analysis ","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"59228ca8","name":"Financial Demand Modelling ","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"518b9f2e","name":"Funding Models  Evaluation ","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"56c32011","name":"Service Provisioning Analysis and Optimization ","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"f0d308e6","name":"Service Valuation ","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"e88711ae","name":"Variable Cost Dynamics Analysis ","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"3456f2e0","name":"Business Process","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"95d9a583","name":"Auditing","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"8892ccd3","name":"Plan & Control Budgets ","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":"Establish budgeting framework based on DoD standards.

provides the business and IT with the quantification (in financial terms) of the value of IT services, the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services, and the qualification of operational forecasting. It includes all function and processes responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging policies and activities.\nKey objectives of Financial Management are:\n• Establishing and enforcing IT financial controls\n• Ensuring compliance with legal, industry, and corporate standards and procedures\nAssisting IT portfolio investment decisions by providing detailed business cases as well as financial input for decision support\n• Effectively predicting and controlling IT budgets\n• Providing the enterprise with operational visibility, insight, and superior decision-making.\nThe overriding goal of Financial Management is to provide cost effective stewardship of the IT assets and the financial resources used in providing IT services. Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organization’s customers.\nThis is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:\n• Hardware and software license costs\n• Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software\n• Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service\n• Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges\n• Taxes, capital or interest charges\n• Compliance costs\n• Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes.\nAccounting\nBudgeting\nBusiness Impact Analysis\nCharging\nFinancial Demand Modelling\nFunding Models  Evaluation\nService Provisioning Analysis and Optimization\nService Valuation\nVariable Cost Dynamics Analysis\n"},{"id":"10b79449","name":"ITIL Roles","viewpoint":"1","documentation":""},{"id":"0ce2c758","name":"ServiceNow","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"1ab165ac","name":"Chargeback/Showback FC","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"ba0c6e6f","name":"Budgeting App Arch","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"992b6526","name":"Accounting","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"07c6e5fe","name":"SMAG Contract","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"8f92b990","name":"Accounting Process L2","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"e0a96c2a","name":"Charging Process L2","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"f1557bac","name":"ITFM L2 Process","viewpoint":"8","documentation":""},{"id":"3caa77db","name":"ITFM Process Interface","viewpoint":"8","documentation":"Inputs\n• Service Level Agreements\n• Service valuation\n• Demand modeling\n• Service investment analysis\n• Estimated costs and cost types\n• Depreciation schedules\n• Service Catalog and CIs.\n\nOutputs\n• Budsget for governance of expenses\n• Actual costs of services\n• Management reporting to assist decision-making\n• Service value potential\n• Authorization\n• Service Portfolio\n• Costing model\n• Charging rates and policies per service\n• Return on Investment, Return on Capital Employed, and Total Cost of Ownership.\n\n\n\n\nSeam Management Authority Matrix\nThe term seam refers to a connection or interaction between one or more organizations. It could be an interaction between business units, business units to IT Service Provider, or IT Service Provider to IT Service Provider. The seam analysis helps to identify the processes, people and technology required to coordinate end to end management of IT Services.\n\nThe following table provides key seam descriptions.\nThe following tables identify key process activities and where possible, associate activity with process seams and key roles.\nThe authority matrix below identifies process activities that can be associated with key roles and/or process seams. These relationships are documented in terms of RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed). This table does NOT represent a RACI mapping to the organization or sub-processes.\n     Seam\n  Seam Descriptions\n   TBD\n       Seam\n  Required ITSM Process Specification\n   will determine a “unit price” (e.g. budget allocation, chargeback, etc.) for each Service.\n       Seam\nRequired ITSM Process Specification\n Process Owner\n  Process Manager\n Service Provider Lead\n  Financial Management Approval Committee\n  Determine the colors of money and how these can be used to fund Services (e.g.)\n• Operations & Maintenance\n  CI\n  AR\n  R\n  R\n \n  ITSM Process Interface Document\n    (O&M) - 1 year cycle\n• Research & Development (R&D) - 2 year cycle\n• Procurement - 3 year cycle\n        Define, calculate and monitor the unit costs of provisioning each Service.\n CI\n  AR\n R\n R\n  Quantify, in financial terms, the value of IT Services and the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services.\n CI\n  AR\n R\n R\n  Review requests for new investments and approve or reject the allocation of the budget and resources.\n CI\n  AR\n R\n R\n  Perform periodic and ad- hoc audits to ensure compliance with the NGEN IT Financial Management strategy and adherence to published procedures and policies.\n CI\n  AR\n R\n R\n  Determine the appropriate pricing for IT Services.\n CI\n  AR\n R\n R\n  Update the Government’s Asset Management tool upon the procurement or update of a service.\n CI\n  AR\n R\n R\n  Monitor and report costs against the budget, review the financial forecasts, and manage costs accordingly.\n  CI\n  AR\n  R\n  R\n             2.4.5 Process Interfaces\nAny process is triggered by an event or activity and associated artifact(s), and produces an output which typically feeds into another process.\nInterfaces\nThis process has a key relationship or dependency with the following ITSM processes:\n• Strategy Generation\n• Service Portfolio Management\n• Demand Management\n• Service Level Management\n• Supplier Management\nPage 24\n • Capacity Management\n• Service Asset and Configuration Management. Inputs\n2.4.6 Roles\nThe following roles have been identified with the process.\nNGEN ITSM Process Interface Document\n         Roles\n  Description\n  Financial Management Process Owner\n The strategic role accountable for the Process.\n  Financial Management Process Manager ( NGEN BFM)\n The tactical role that performs cross segment coordination of the quantification, in financial terms, of the value of IT Services and the value of assets underlying the provisioning of those services.\n   Page 25\n NGEN ITSM Process Interface Document\n    Financial Management Approval Committee\n  Reviews requests for new investments and approves or rejects the allocation of budget and resources.\n 2.4.7 Performance Metrics\nThe effectiveness and performance of the process are measured using metrics-based Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which support high level Critical Success Factors (CSFs). The CSFs and KPIs below are examples which may or may not reflect actual Key Performance Parameters (KPPs).\n     CSF #\nCritical Success Factors\n  KPI #\n  Key Performance Indicators\n  1\n                    Provide Effective Stewardship of IT Finances\n  1\n Unplanned Cost Variance. NGEN must provide the Navy and Marine Corps with improved cost planning to inform DON Program Objective decisions and to effectively use allocated budget. = Total to-date planned budget costs minus Total IT budget\n  2\n Cost Performance Index. NGEN will employ financial resources fully and not exceed planned and authorized budget. = Total to-date planned budget costs divided by Total to-date actual budget costs.\n  3\n Estimated Year-End Costs. Determine how much will actually be spent at the end of the fiscal year. = Total IT budget multiplied by the Cost Performance Index KPI.\n  4\n Variance at Budget Year-End. Determine how much will the NGEN program be over or under its fiscal IT budget. = Estimated Year- End Costs KPI minus the Total IT budget.\n  6\n Financial Management Process Maturity. NGEN will execute financial management to a high-level of process maturity. Evaluated as a COBIT maturity process level.\n  8\n Number of Financial Reports/Forecasts Delivered Late. The NGEN financial management process will ensure financial reports are delivered on time.\n  2\n    Maintain Overall Effectiveness of the IT Financial Management Process\n   5\n Financial Management Tooling Support Level. NGEN toolsets that support financial management activities will facilitate the high level of process maturity. Evaluated as a COBIT maturity process level.\n  6\n  Financial Management Process Maturity.\n             Page 26\n NGEN ITSM Process Interface Document\n \nNGEN will execute financial management to a high-level of process maturity.

NGEN toolsets that support financial management activities will facilitate the high level of process maturity. Evaluated as a COBIT maturity process level.\n7\nIT Invoicing/Payment Variance. Determine how much of obligated funds were not actually paid out. = Total obligated funds minus Total paid funds.\n4\nEnsure Customers are Satisfied with Costs and Charges for Services\n9\n Number of Changes to Charging Algorithms. Changes to algorithms used to formulate payment for IT Services is an indicator of customer satisfaction. If no changes and customers are satisfied, no changes were needed. If no changes and customers are dissatisfied, changes should’ve been made. If changes were made and customers are still dissatisfied, changes were inadequate or incorrect.\n \n \n  2.4.8 Tools Interface Requirements\nThe following known tool interfaces requirements should be considered during further development of the process:\n• Financial System (ERP, etc.)\n• Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS)"},{"id":"eb78cc1e","name":"ITFM Swimlane Process","viewpoint":"","documentation":""}]}
