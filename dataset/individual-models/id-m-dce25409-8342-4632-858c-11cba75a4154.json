Interoperability for End to End processes supporting Digital Collaboration and maintaining interoperability within the ArchiMate Digital Business Ecosystem","viewpoint":"","documentation":"Part 6: a more systematic approach for testing ArchiMate interoperability?\n\nThe needs\n\nOn the previous parts of the article, I mainly pointed out some kinds of issue, with some dedicated testing procedures I created on the run when encountering problems.\n\nBut many more issues can be identified, simply related to errors when implementing and insufficient tests during implementation. It is in particular the case for the constraints on modeling constructs which can be linked on the base of the ArchiMate relationships.\n\nIn the article \"Linked Enterprises: from ArchiMate language to ArchiMate Web Ontology?\", I assessed the effort to be made for deriving an ontology from the ArchiMate langage. The effort is quite similar, even higher, when willing to deal with systematic testing and test data set creation.\n\nFist we have to check that all the modeling constructs which are not relations can be interchange. So we need a model with one model element of each type.\nThen we need to check that all the allowed relationship can be interchanged.\nAlso, we need to check that the non allowed relationships are properly managed by the tools.\nIf not allowed relationships are described in an exchange file, does it lead to a software error or if it is managed in order to indicated that an issue is to be corrected in the model, or could it be properly managed as an extension/modification of the set of constraints to be applied?\nCan we exchange the diagrams without loosing the content?\nCan we exchange the diagrams without loosing the form?\nAre the information related to viewpoints typing the views correctly exchanged?\nDo constraints related to viewpoints create errors if not enforced by tools which are the source of exchange using the open format?\nAre the folders/packages structure (breakdowns) interchanged or lost?\nAre the properties for each model element preserved or not during interchange?\nCan stereotypes as proposed in ArchiMate 3 can be created and interchanged?\nThe open format for ArchiMate model interchanged being a realization of the specification, it should be assessed as well, with response to the question:\n\n12. Are ArchiMate specifications and XML Schema proposed for Open Exchange format aligned.\n\nIn addition, the question of the preservation of IDs occurs.\n\n13. Can the IDs being preserved occurs between the different applications?\n\n14. How do we manage Reference Data, or consistency between several reference data management system?\n\nSo what are then the test data sets to create in order to validate each of the 14 points identified?\n\nHere a first model with one element per construct is to be produced, without any view. It means 59 model elements. In order to anticipate the next test and to be able to create relationships between two model elements with the same type, we can double the number of model elements, 2 with the same kind in the model.\nHere, starting from the previous test  data set, we should create a new test data set with a link per allowed relation, and shake that they are preserved by exchange loop. We can also start from the test file to be created for 3, with all the kind of relations created between all the kind of objects, without considering the restrictions, and then remove the relations which should not be allowed.\nHere, starting from the previous test data sets (1 or 2), we need to have a link per not allowed relation, and shake how  interchange behave. Error for the import? Indication that some imported link are not allowed? As most of the tools are constraining the links that can be created, creation of such data set should be made without using a modeling tool (potential exception: EA). Creating an XML interchange file can be difficult using a text file editor. Creating it automatically with a program is probably the most efficient way, knowing that 59*59*11 links should be created in order covering all the cases. Creation using user interface of modeling tools, even for 2, is very long and error prone. So automation is highly recommended for creation of the test file. It can eventually be made manually, using some textual template which allow to make if fast, even manually, with a text editor. The produced model should respect the schemas provided by the Open Group with the Open Exchange Format for ArchiMate specification. So a validating parser should also be available if we want to ensure that the produced test files are valid.\nIdem\nHere we can use the model created for 3, and create one view (layered) with all the model element displayed. We can then check automatically if one visual representation exist per model element in the created view.\nLet's consider that the different kind of automated layout could lead to differences between diagrams. So it should be checked if the visual representation of model element is preserved. For entities, location and size. It is more complicated for links, which can be created using many layouts which are tools dependent.\nFrom the test data set of 2, we can create a set of views, one for each viewpoint, and display on it all the model elements which are allowed in such a viewpoint. Then by interchange, are the viewpoints preserved and indication on what can or can't be part of each viewpoint is the same for each tool? Could be done by program or by a person checking on a modeling tool.\nHere we should created a test data set similar to the initially proposed one, with as model elements those proposed for 7 and distribution in the packages in a way that could be checked automatically.\nHere we can created from the model with all allowed constructs a set of views, one per viewpoint, with all the model elements displayed in the view with Archi (which support it, and just apply ghosting to model elements which should not be displayed for the viewpoint.\nHere we can create from the model with all allowed constructs a new test data model with added properties, with names and values which could be tested by program.\nLet's create a stereotype with a modeling tool supporting this modeling future, and let's try interchange\nLet's check if the format can be mapped with each part of the specification studying the documents. Full interchange loop with the data set created in 7 should be another way to validate it, except for stereotypes, folders/packages or properties which are not necessarily 100% aligned between ArchiMate specification and interchange format.\nThe first attempt for creating test data set\n\nI started to work with following exactly what was described in the description of the needs (which were updated according to the lessons learnt from this first attempt).\n\nHere some captures of test data sets I created by hand, first with Modelio, but it was very long. I then continued with Archi, which allowed to make it quicker. But still to long. It is why I think that automation should be the way, not only for creating testing data, but also for checking.  \n\nLet's note I didn't rely on test data sets available from the Open Group communities, as it doesn't seem they are containing all the data required for testing constraints on relationships, or behavior when data are provided which are not respecting the constraints. \n\nAlso, another goal is to consider some optional requirements or differences between actual implementations which are tool specific. The objective here is not to certify a solution, but to assess and to qualify a collaboration environment between organizational units or enterprises having their own EA repositories based on heterogeneous solutions, being certified by Open Group or not. I leant from my past experience in the PLM area (Product and Process data exchange, sharing and long term archiving in the manufacturing domain and within extended enterprise) that a global collaboration system is to be qualified and can't rely only on usage of certified components which are not qualified within the actual collaboration context and environment (containing system).\n\nThe views/diagrams on the next snapshots are quite ugly, and I received many comments about the fact that they are useless models for supporting decision making by Enterprise stakeholders. But it is absolutely not the intended usage of the produced models: the goal is to assess networks of applications which are EA modeling tools/ EA model repositories, which should be implied for building End to End collaboration for a network of organisations.\n\n\n\nBecause of the required time, I changed my way of producing test models, and updated the \"needs\" section consequently. I also started to draft an approach using ArchiMate which is described in the following sub section.\n\n A first draft model of a systematic approach\n\n\nThe model contains first the set of goals from which test data and test processes are to be created. It should correspond to the 14 points in the previous \"Needs\" section (I didn't align it yet).\n\nThen relying on a set up testing environment, derived from the environment depicted in the   Part 1 of the article, a test plan is to be created, with testing tasks to be run, following testing procedure/protocols which can be made generic and applied systematically with all the solutions to be assessed. The content of the test files will be created in order to achieve the testing goals, relying on what is described on the \"Needs\" section for creating test data sets\n\nOf course, proposing this approach was strongly related with starting to experiment, and some interesting results can already be shared.\n\nA first interesting result: when creating a model with not allowed relationships between some kind of elements (constraints associated to relationships in the ArchiMate specification), I was able to import it in Archi without any problem: no error signaled and no stop of the import. It means that we can have invalide models in Archi when importing. What is the impact? Is it something that should be allowed to have invalide model? It seems to me it is not a problem if the tool allows to analyze it and indicates what makes the model invalid? It is then up to the people producing models to decide how they will deal with this, and it they accept to work on models with some relaxed constrains. But is also mean that all the tools should have the same capability. From experience, I'm not always happy with the constrains put on the relationships by the ArchiMate specifications, and being able to relax it   is something I'm expecting, even if conscious it has an impact on interoperability.\n\nA second interesting result: when I imported some models with Modelio, I had some rejection of the import without any indication of the reason why the model was rejected. A problem I faced is that sometimes, the same model was accepted  and sometimes, it was not. Without indication of the problem (here I've to investigate if some logs are indicating the problem), it is quite difficult to perform analysis. So one expectation for any tool providing import capabilities is to have indication of the reason why they are refusing to perform some import.\n\nA third interesting result: as I created XML file manually, I was able to understand better the structure of the schemas associated to the Open Group's Open Exchange Format for ArchiMate, in particular the \"Organisation\" and \"Viewpoints\" sections. The first one is about  how the model elements physically decomposed. It is related to the Part 2 of the article, dealing with issue encountered with preservation of the physical breakdown when using EA. Such physical structure of a model is not part of the ArchiMate language (unlike UML which include modeling of packages or containment in the language specifications). So it means that for dealing with interoperability for ArchiMate, considering the language only is insufficient, we also need to consider the structuration of models as proposed by the interchange format. I think it is an underspecification of the language, as such organisation is always displayed on user interface with \"Project\" or \"Model\" pan indicating such organisation. Solution providers are free to call it \"folder\" or \"package\", so we have something \"nebulous\" here which may lead to interoperability issues, i.e. data loss in exchange loops.\n\nA fourth interesting result: there is a section \"viewpoint\" in the exchange schema. For each viewpoint, it provides the list of supported modeling objects which can be used for a viewpoint. It is quite interesting if willing to be able to create you own viewpoints, knowing that proposed viewpoints by ArchiMate are not anymore part of the specifications. It is since ArchiMate 3 just a set of examples. The problem is that some tools are today structuring ArchiMate modeling on proposed viewpoints (e.g. Archi or EA) without proposing ways to create new viewpoints and to exchange what they can contain. Modelio do it, but when you try to exchange a model through the open format with tools like Archi, you have an error due to the presence for the viewpoint section. If accepting it, an issue will be how to manage  viewpoints which are not those described in the specifications, if creation and management of viewpoints is not part of the capabilities of the modeling tools.\n\nMore will come from next experimentation.\n\n"}]}
