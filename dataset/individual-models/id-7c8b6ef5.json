A business actor that is assigned to a business role ultimately performs the corresponding behavior. A business role may be assigned to one or more business processes or business functions, while a business actor may be assigned to a business role. \n\nA business interface or an application interface may be used by a business role, while a business interface may be part of a business role (through a composition relationship, which is not shown explicitly in the interface notation).
