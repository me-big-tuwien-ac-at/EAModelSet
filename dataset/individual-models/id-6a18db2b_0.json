quantification (in financial terms) of the value of IT services, the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services, and the qualification of operational forecasting. It includes all function and processes responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging policies and activities.\nKey objectives of Financial Management are:\n• Establishing and enforcing IT financial controls\n• Ensuring compliance with legal, industry, and corporate standards and procedures\nAssisting IT portfolio investment decisions by providing detailed business cases as well as financial input for decision support\n• Effectively predicting and controlling IT budgets\n• Providing the enterprise with operational visibility, insight, and superior decision-making.\nThe overriding goal of Financial Management is to provide cost effective stewardship of the IT assets and the financial resources used in providing IT services. Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organization’s customers.\nThis is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:\n• Hardware and software license costs\n• Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software\n• Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service\n• Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges\n• Taxes, capital or interest charges\n• Compliance costs\n• Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes."},{"id":"b8c6dd55","name":"Business Impact Analysis","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-59228ca8","name":"Financial Demand Modelling","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-518b9f2e","name":"Funding Models  Evaluation","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-56c32011","name":"Service Provisioning Analysis and Optimization","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"f0d308e6","name":"Service Valuation","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"e88711ae","name":"Variable Cost Dynamics Analysis","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-3456f2e0","name":"Business Process","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-95d9a583","name":"Auditing","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":""},{"id":"id-8892ccd3","name":"Plan & Control Budgets","type":"BusinessProcess","layer":"business","documentation":"Establish budgeting framework based on DoD standards.

Use budget plans as the basis to compare your actual versus planned expenses.\n\nBudget plans are associated with a budget key and a fiscal period. If you have financial data over several financial periods, make a separate plan for each period.\n\nThere are several types of items you can add to the budget plan. The costs of these items are broken down over the fiscal period that you specify for the plan. See Budget items and Budget item breakdowns for more information.\n\nBudget plan expense amount types\n\nBudget plans show these types of expense amounts:\n\nTarget amounts: An amount that you set as a goal to reach or a limit not to exceed. A target amount is created for a specific fiscal period and account code combination. When you select the account code and fiscal period for the budget plan, the target amount is automatically populated in the read-only target fields. There are targets for both operating and capital expenses.\nBudgeted amounts: A rollup of all the budget plan items, which appear as related lists on the Budget Plan form. Only items marked as capital expenses do not roll up to the amount fields. There are budgeted amounts for both operating and capital expenses.\nBudget plan ownership\n\nBudget plans have a single owner, who must have the budget_owner role. Whoever you chose as the budget owner must also be associated with the budget plan's budget key as an owner.\n\nBudget plan parent-child relationships\n\nBudget plans can have one or more sub-plans, which roll up their actual budget amounts to the parent budget plan. You cannot promote child plans individually. Only the top-level plan in a hierarchy can be promoted.\n\nThe same account codes can be used for parent and any or all child plans, if necessary. Child plans can also have account codes that are lower in the hierarchy. For example, if the parent's account code is IT finance, the child plan's account code could be IT finance > Auditing Service, or similar. If you have multiple sub-plans with the same account codes, the amounts roll up from all subplans to the forecast.\n\nChanging the fiscal period parent plan cascades the change down to all sub-plans. See Budget owners and budget key owners for more information.\n\nBudget plan promotion\n\nYou can promote a budget plan to a budget forecast, based on the plan's account code and fiscal period. The forecast helps you predict the expenses your organization will incur. See Budget forecasts for more information.\n\nCreate a budget plan\nAfter you have configured your budget target and account codes, create a budget plan.\n\nCopy a budget plan\nYou can use any plan as a basis for creating a new plan.\n\nBudget items\nThe items that comprise a budget plan come from several other applications in an instance, including Asset Management, Project Management, and Configuration Management. This enables you to budget your expenses for items across your IT infrastructure."},{"id":"e5f41868","name":"SNITFM_Budget Labor

Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organization’s customers.\nThis is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:\n• Hardware and software license costs\n• Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software\n• Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service\n• Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges\n• Taxes, capital or interest charges\n• Compliance costs\n• Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes.\nAccounting\nBudgeting\nBusiness Impact Analysis\nCharging\nFinancial Demand Modelling\nFunding Models  Evaluation\nService Provisioning Analysis and Optimization\nService Valuation\nVariable Cost Dynamics Analysis"},{"id":"f1557bac","name":"ITFM L2 Process","viewpoint":"","documentation":""},{"id":"id-3caa77db","name":"ITFM Process Interface","viewpoint":"","documentation":"Inputs\n• Service Level Agreements\n• Service valuation\n• Demand modeling\n• Service investment analysis\n• Estimated costs and cost types\n• Depreciation schedules\n• Service Catalog and CIs.\n\nOutputs\n• Budsget for governance of expenses\n• Actual costs of services\n• Management reporting to assist decision-making\n• Service value potential\n• Authorization\n• Service Portfolio\n• Costing model\n• Charging rates and policies per service\n• Return on Investment, Return on Capital Employed, and Total Cost of Ownership.\n\n\n\n\nSeam Management Authority Matrix\nThe term seam refers to a connection or interaction between one or more organizations. It could be an interaction between business units, business units to IT Service Provider, or IT Service Provider to IT Service Provider. The seam analysis helps to identify the processes, people and technology required to coordinate end to end management of IT Services.\n\nThe following table provides key seam descriptions.\nThe following tables identify key process activities and where possible, associate activity with process seams and key roles.\nThe authority matrix below identifies process activities that can be associated with key roles and/or process seams. These relationships are documented in terms of RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed).
