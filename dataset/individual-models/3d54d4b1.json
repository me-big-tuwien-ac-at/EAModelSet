They are not necessarily mandatory but should always be considered by a user of the EIRA when executing one of its use cases.\r\n\r\nNarrative: A [Public Policy] is implemented by a [Public Service] which can be an aggregation of other [Public Services] . The [Public Service] is realised by [Business Capabilities] describing key functions supporting the service. A [Business Capability] can contain [Business Information Exchanges] which describe interactions between public administrations, businesses, and citizens. A [Business Information Exchange] accesses [Business Information] realized by a [Representation] of [Data]. The representation is influenced by a [Data Policy], which may in turn be influenced by a [Public Policy]. An [Interoperable European Solution] supports one or more [Public Services] and lets users access it via [Machine to Machine Interfaces] and/or [Human Interfaces]. An [Interoperable European Solution] exposes [Application Services] via its [Machine to Machine Interfaces] and Human Interfaces]. It makes use of [Orchestration Services] and [Choreography Services]. The [Interoperable European Solution] uses [Digital Service Infrastructure] and [Hosting and Networking Infrastructure Service]. It can also use other [Interoperable European Solutions].\r\n"},{"id":"7a468f58","name":"Organisational view","viewpoint":"","documentation":"The Organisational view models the most important building blocks that shall be considered in order to support organisational interoperability among providers and users of a public service.\r\n\r\nNarrative: [Organisations] in the role of [Public Service Providers] supply [Public Services] to [Citizens] and [Businesses] and/or [Public Administrations] which have the role of [Public Service Consumer]. The [Public Service] is delivered according to its [Service Delivery Model].  [Public Services] are documented in [Public Service Catalogues] that can be used among others for service portfolio management.\r\n[Public Service Providers] can delegate the delivery of [Public Services] to [Public Service Delivery Agents] who will act on behalf of [Public Service Providers].\r\n[Public Service Providers] can sign an [Interoperability Provider Agreement] to agree on how to deliver a [Public Service] to its users. The delivery of these public services is realised through [Business Capabilities] using [Business Information Exchanges] and [Business Information]. [Business Information] is instance oriented and is subject to [Business Rules] originating from [Organisational Enablers] like [Organisational Structures], [Organisational Procedures], [Organisational Policies] or the [Organisational Skills] of the [Organisations] involved.\r\nThe [Interoperability Organisational Authority] is responsible for [Interoperability Governance] which influences the [Interoperability Strategy].

Given the linked nature of the EIRA‚Äôs views, the interoperability specifications from all views can be considered to affect each individual catalogue or registry.
