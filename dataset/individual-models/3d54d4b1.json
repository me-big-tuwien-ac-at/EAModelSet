An [Interoperable European Solution] supports one or more [Public Services] and lets users access it via [Machine to Machine Interfaces] and/or [Human Interfaces]. An [Interoperable European Solution] exposes [Application Services] via its [Machine to Machine Interfaces] and Human Interfaces]. It makes use of [Orchestration Services] and [Choreography Services]. The [Interoperable European Solution] uses [Digital Service Infrastructure] and [Hosting and Networking Infrastructure Service]. It can also use other [Interoperable European Solutions].\r\n"},{"id":"7a468f58","name":"Organisational view","viewpoint":"","documentation":"The Organisational view models the most important building blocks that shall be considered in order to support organisational interoperability among providers and users of a public service.\r\n\r\nNarrative: [Organisations] in the role of [Public Service Providers] supply [Public Services] to [Citizens] and [Businesses] and/or [Public Administrations] which have the role of [Public Service Consumer]. The [Public Service] is delivered according to its [Service Delivery Model].  [Public Services] are documented in [Public Service Catalogues] that can be used among others for service portfolio management.\r\n[Public Service Providers] can delegate the delivery of [Public Services] to [Public Service Delivery Agents] who will act on behalf of [Public Service Providers].\r\n[Public Service Providers] can sign an [Interoperability Provider Agreement] to agree on how to deliver a [Public Service] to its users. The delivery of these public services is realised through [Business Capabilities] using [Business Information Exchanges] and [Business Information]. [Business Information] is instance oriented and is subject to [Business Rules] originating from [Organisational Enablers] like [Organisational Structures], [Organisational Procedures], [Organisational Policies] or the [Organisational Skills] of the [Organisations] involved.\r\nThe [Interoperability Organisational Authority] is responsible for [Interoperability Governance] which influences the [Interoperability Strategy].

Each EIRA view has architecture building blocks that support interoperability.\r\n\r\nEach view’s interoperability specifications serve to define the interoperability aspects of catalogues and registries, addressing both their contents and the respective catalogue or registry as a whole. Given the linked nature of the EIRA’s views, the interoperability specifications from all views can be considered to affect each individual catalogue or registry. However, the focus in each case is kept within the specific view to best capture the level of detail that each view’s specifications deal with.\r\n\r\nNarrative: An [Interoperability Specification] is a [Specification]. An [Interoperability Specification] can depend on other [Interoperability Specifications]. It exists at the four levels of interoperability defined in the European Interoperability Framework: \r\n•\tAt the legal level a [Legal Interoperability Specification] is associated to [Public Policy Formulation and Implement Instrument] and/or documented in [Legislation Catalogue].\r\n•\tAt the organisational level an [Organisational Interoperability Specification] is described with the help of [Interoperability Agreements] and/or documented in [Public Service Catalogue].\r\n•\tAt the semantic level a [Semantic Interoperability Specification] has the form of [Data Set Catalogue] and/or [Data Standards Catalogue].\r\n•\tAt the technical level a [Technical Interoperability Specification] is a [Technical Specification] describing aspects of the underlying system. The [Service Registry Component] provides a mechanism to register technical services within a catalogue to be discovered by others.\r\n\r\n"},{"id":"26adaffa","name":"Technical view - infrastructure","viewpoint":"","documentation":null}]}
