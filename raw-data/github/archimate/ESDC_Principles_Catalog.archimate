&#xD;
Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.&#xD;
Design services digitally from end‑to‑end to meet the Government of Canada users and other stakeholders’ needs&#xD;
Clearly identify internal and external users and other stakeholders and their needs for each policy, program and business service&#xD;
In order to ensure that a service will be able to meet the users and stakeholders' needs, it needs to understand what needs it is trying to provide service for, who their users and stakeholders are, both internal and external.&#xD;
Once the needs, the users and stakeholders are defined, then a service provider can proceed to create a stakeholder mapping to further understand the relationship between the service and the users &amp; stakeholders, ie. how a change in one component impacts the other.&#xD;
From there, the service provider can conduct need analysis of its users and stakeholder to develop a program, a policy or a service that meets their needs (this practice may also be known as stakeholder requirements or value mapping).&#xD;
This exercise can also help define the limitation/scope of the program/policy/service to better manage the expectation of their users/stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * summarize the needs and outcome of each key external and internal stakeholders in scope of the architecture&#xD;
    * demonstrate how the architecture is focused on the needs and outcomes of internal and external stakeholders&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Case&#xD;
    * Stakeholder (Actors, Roles, Organizational Units) Mapping &amp; Stakeholder requirements &#xD;
    * Outcomes&#xD;
    * Business Process Map&#xD;
    * Value Stream and Value Mapping&#xD;
&#xD;
include policy requirement applying to specific users and other stakeholder groups, such as accessibility, gender-based plus analysis, and official languages in the creation of the service&#xD;
To ensure that a service can be used by all its users, it is important to note the specific requirements for specific users and to that extent, it is important to take note and apply the policy that governs the service standards when providing service to the specific user groups.&#xD;
This will in turn enable the service to be far-reaching and more inclusive to all its users.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline what policies constrain the architecture&#xD;
    * Outline positive and negative impact the policy has on the architecture to meet the needs of the stakeholder&#xD;
    * Outline how architecture supports full spectrum of service design and user experience&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * User Interface Design Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
perform Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) to support risk mitigation activities when deploying an automated decision system as per Directive on Automated Decision-Making&#xD;
When a service has an in-system developed automation for decision making, it is essential that the service perform AIA, to ensure that the result of this decision making is impartial and fair, and the impact of that decision would be the same as if the decision is made manually, only faster.&#xD;
The use of this type of system must closely follow the Directive on Automated Decision-Making.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Provide the impact level based on the completion of the conceptual AIA&#xD;
    * Describe how the architecture will address the recommendations coming from the AIA&#xD;
    * Describe how the architecture meets the directive's requirements for the impact level&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * AIA Results (Conceptual)&#xD;
&#xD;
Model end-to-end business service delivery to provide quality, maximize effectiveness and optimize efficiencies across all channels (for example, lean process)&#xD;
When creating a service, make sure the service delivery is modeled end-to-end to make sure the intended end users can actually reap the benefit of the service being offered.&#xD;
Go through the business process map step-by-step to ensure all points/nodes within the process behaves expectedly resulting in an intended outcome.&#xD;
Ensure all points/nodes within the process is optimized.&#xD;
Create all possible positive and negative scenarios that can possibly occur.&#xD;
Then go through different possible scenarios to ensure the service is still being delivered correctly, effectively and efficiently.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Summarize the delivery of value to customer across the architecture’s  business ecosystem  and the contribution of each stakeholder to the value&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Process Map&#xD;
    * Business Impact Assessment&#xD;
    * Value Stream and Value Mapping&#xD;
&#xD;
Architect to be outcome‑driven and strategically aligned to the department and to the Government of Canada&#xD;
identify which departmental/GC business services, outcomes and strategies will be addressed&#xD;
To ensure that the Government of Canada provide the best service to its citizen, the services provided needs to be cohesive, ie. the work conducted by each department needs to complement each other to avoid overlap and to ensure continuance of service from one department to another.&#xD;
In order for a service to be meaningful, it needs to be tied into the driver of why the service is required and the outcome expected from a departmental mandate. The service can affect the mandate directly/indirectly, however, one needs to justify the needs of the service in relation to the actual mandate of the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline the GC/Departmental Strategies the architect aligns and/or implements&#xD;
    * Describe the architecture's contribution to realizing the appropriate outcomes of the strategy&#xD;
   Artifacts:&#xD;
    * Drivers&#xD;
    * Outcomes (intimidate and ultimate)&#xD;
    * Business services (External)&#xD;
&#xD;
establish metrics for identified business outcomes throughout the life cycle of an investment&#xD;
Once we know which outcome that a service is tied into, and whether or not it is directly affecting the outcome expected, we need to be able to justify the effort required to build the service vs. the outcome exerted by the service.&#xD;
We need a way to quantify the impact of this service / establish a metrics for this service.&#xD;
This is an important step to ensure that we can prioritize the effort correctly to identify and build the right service that is of high priority with the budget assigned.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * What are the metrics used to ensure that the outcomes are being realized&#xD;
    * What data is required for the metrics and identify how any gaps in the data will be addressed.&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Value Stream (Measure KPI linked to benefits outcomes and objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
translate business outcomes and strategy into business capability implications in the GC Business Capability Model to establish a common vocabulary between business, development, and operation&#xD;
Once we understood the outcomes and strategy to achieve the outcome, we need to translate it into business capability implications. Historically, the Business Capability Model is a common vocabulary between business, development and operation.&#xD;
When the plan conveyed is understood by the development and operation, it would be easier to obtain the system required.&#xD;
Having an open communication between the various teams also helps in getting the right solution that closely match the business requirement.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline the business capabilities involved in achieving each outcome&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Impact Assessment&#xD;
    * Departmental BCM&#xD;
    * GC BCM (mapping to D BCM)&#xD;
    * Value Stream&#xD;
Promote horizontal enablement of the enterprise&#xD;
identify opportunities to enable business services horizontally across the GC enterprise and to provide cohesive experience to users and other stakeholders&#xD;
In creating any service, we always need to go back to think about the users/stakeholders. Put ourselves in the users'/stakeholders' shoes. If we are at the receiving end of the service, what kind of experience do we get when we are trying to get the service. Does the user need to know where to get related services, or can we provide them with a seamless service, a cohesive service ? How do we provide a good experience to the users / stakeholders ?&#xD;
We need to start thinking more of an enterprise level, starting at the departmental level first. How can we enable this service across the department ? Is there any opportunity to reuse what we have in other areas of the department ? What do we need to do to leverage this process ?&#xD;
We need to plug in to community of practices, network of expertise or other working groups in order to exchange information, understand the various obstacles experienced by others, get lessons learned from others' experiences, share lessons learned, learn from others how they overcome similar obstacles in their work, share your solutions to others.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Summarize the departmental / GC opportunities where the architecture could be reused&#xD;
    * Summarize departmental/GC architectures that impact or influence the ability of the user having a cohesive experience&#xD;
       (what are the plans to ensure user has a cohesive experience across these architectures and the ecosystem)&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Capability&#xD;
    * Departmental Value Stream model&#xD;
    * Projects to Value Stream Script&#xD;
&#xD;
reuse common business capabilities, processes and enterprise solutions from across government and private sector&#xD;
If there is a business capabilities, processes or enterprise solution that can be utilized in creating the service, eg. perhaps during the exchange of information from working groups, community of practices, workshops or even from working with private sectors, that are proven to work, we should consider using it prior to inventing our own.&#xD;
This will optimize the time required to build the approach or the solution. Rather than having to proof the concept or solution actually works, use the ones that have a proven record.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Describe the plan and approach to standardize the realization of the business capability so it can be reused within the department and GC&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Projects to value Stream Script&#xD;
    * Business Capability Heat map&#xD;
&#xD;
publish in the open all reusable common business capabilities, processes and enterprise solutions for others to develop and leverage cohesive horizontal enterprise services&#xD;
Going back to the previous point on thinking at an enterprise level, one of the ways to enable a service that we build across the GC is by having it published in the open for other departments to see and re-use. Then and only we can create a cohesive horizontal enterprise services to create a cohesive experience to the users / stakeholders.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline the plan to allow other public sector organizations to reuse the common capability&#xD;

&#xD;
Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.&#xD;

      <documentation>Appendix B: Development of EA Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
The development of architecture principles is typically influenced by the following :&#xD;
•	Enterprise mission and plans: The mission, plans, and organizational infrastructure of the enterprise. &#xD;
•	Enterprise strategic initiatives: The characteristics of the enterprise; its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, and its current enterprise-wide initiatives (such as process improvement and quality management). &#xD;
•	External constraints: Market factors (time-to-market imperatives, customer expectations, etc.); existing and potential legislation. &#xD;
•	Current systems and technology: The set of information resources deployed within the enterprise, including systems documentation, equipment inventories, network configuration diagrams, policies, and procedures. &#xD;
•	Emerging industry trends: Predictions about economic, political, technical, and market factors that influence the enterprise environment. &#xD;
&#xD;
The EA Principles are developed by following a systematic process to create, socialize, approve and communicate them to ensure that they will have the desired effect. This process involves the following five key steps :&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 1- Identification of the EA Principles: The EA Principles identified in this document were mostly derived from previous EA Principle documents. The following main sources were consulted and leveraged: &#xD;
•	The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Treasury Board defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	(Draft) DFO-MPO Enterprise Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Correctional Service Canada (CSC) defined Architecture Principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 2- Definition of the EA Principles: Once identified, the principles are further defined along the following five criteria and properly documented to fit ESDC’s business needs. EA Principles should be few in number and future-oriented.&#xD;
•	Understandable: The intention of the principle is clear and unambiguous so that it can be quickly grasped and understood by individuals throughout the organization.&#xD;
•	Robust: The principle will enable good quality decisions about architectures and plans to be made and enforceable policies and standards to be created. Each principle should be sufficiently definitive and precise to support consistent decision-making in complex, potentially controversial situations.&#xD;
•	Complete: Every potentially important principle governing the management of information and technology for the organization is defined. The principles cover every situation perceived.&#xD;
•	Consistent: Strict adherence to one principle may require a loose interpretation of another principle. The set of principles must be expressed in a way that allows a balance of interpretations. &#xD;
•	Stable: Principles should be enduring, yet able to accommodate change. An amendment process should be established for adding, removing, or altering principles after they are initially ratified.&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 3 – Revision of EA Principles: Architects within EA/IM Directorate are initially engaged to review and revise the proposed EA Principles. Following that initial revision, some additional key stakeholders could also be engaged in the revision as required. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 4 – Governance and Communication: Once the revision is completed and the EA Principles are agreed upon, they will be governed, endorsed and communicated within ESDC. Senior management will then champion the EA Principles. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 5 – Leveraging the EA principles: The EA Principles will be used as an important tool for Departmental governance within the Gating process of any technology projects. They provide a firm foundation for making architecture and planning decisions, framing policies, procedures and standards, and supporting resolution of contradictory situations.</documentation>

Enterprise Architecture Framework&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework is the criteria used by the Government of Canada enterprise architecture review board and departmental architecture review boards when reviewing digital initiatives to ensure their alignment with enterprise architectures across business, information, application, technology and security domains to support strategic outcomes. The EA Framework came into effect on December 1, 2020 and is a replacement of Appendix A, Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment from the Directive on Service and Digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework provide details on the requirements set out in the following sections of the Policy and Directive on Service and Digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.2.3 of the Policy on Service and Digital. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Canada is responsible for: Prescribing expectations with regard to enterprise architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.2.4 of the Policy on Service and Digital. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Canada is responsible for: Establishing and chairing an enterprise architecture review board that is mandated to define current and target architecture standards for the Government of Canada and review departmental proposals for alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.1.1 of the Directive on Service and Digital. The departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for: Chairing a departmental architecture review board that is mandated to review and approve the architecture of all departmental digital initiatives and ensure their alignment with enterprise architectures.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework will be published on Canada.ca. Until then here is the EA Framework.</documentation>

&#xD;
Name:	Enterprise First&#xD;
Statement:	Provide maximum long-term benefits to the enterprise as a whole, while optimizing total costs of ownership and risks.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Enterprise needs over business unit or project needs&#xD;
•	Enterprise priorities are above priorities of a business unit or a project&#xD;
•	Decisions based on the whole government have a greater long-term value than decisions with a certain perspective of a group with a specific interest&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Client needs must be addressed and opportunities leveraged for creating value by considering and selecting the appropriate approach and solutions in the following order:&#xD;
    o	Pan-Canadian ; then;&#xD;
    o	Government of Canada whole-of-government; then&#xD;
    o	Government of Canada Cluster; then&#xD;
    o	Department-wide, holistic and horizontal; then&#xD;
    o	Program or project specific.&#xD;
•	The reach of  an architecture  should allow for  Act as one &#xD;
•	Solutions must aim to maximize the cumulative business benefits over their entire lifecycle.&#xD;
•	Investment proposals must link to business/IT strategy and goals.&#xD;
•	Business value realization must be tracked and demonstrated on all major investments. &#xD;
•	Common solutions and shared services that benefit the enterprise over one-off solutions for one sector or region are preferred. &#xD;
•	Organizational readiness for adopting new solutions are analyzed and taken into account.&#xD;

      <documentation>3.1.	Business Continuity&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Business Continuity&#xD;
Statement:	Operations are maintained in case of events that may or are known to cause service or system interruptions.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Business activities continue regardless of external events. &#xD;
•	Hardware failure, natural disasters, and data corruption do not disrupt or stop enterprise activities. &#xD;
•	The enterprise business functions are capable of operating leveraging redundant information delivery mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	The risks of business interruption must be established in advance and managed. (Management includes but is not limited to planning, testing and monitoring business continuity and IT service recovery, periodic reviews, testing for vulnerabilities and exposure, or designing mission-critical services in a way that ensures business function continuity through redundant or alternative capabilities.)&#xD;
•	Services and applications must be assessed for criticality and impact on the ESDC’s mission to determine which continuity level is required and which corresponding recovery plan must be implemented.&#xD;
•	Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability of enabling services and systems must be considered throughout their design and use. &#xD;
•	Technology lifecycle must be actively managed.&#xD;
•	Technology must be regularly and proactively upgraded.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Accessibility&#xD;
Statement:	ESDC services are accessible on an equitable basis to clients&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Government services needs to be accessible to the widest set of consumers. Channel independence ensures that clients have a choice of access options. While information and services need to be accessed in a variety of ways, the information and services must be delivered in an integrated, consistent fashion.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Services should be designed to operate consistently across multiple delivery channels.&#xD;
•	Programs will need to resource significant additional effort in human interface design.&#xD;
•	In designing services, programs will need to consider accessibility by, and interoperability with, automated services.&#xD;

      <documentation>3.3.	Value&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Value&#xD;
Statement:	Government business initiatives and investments must represent value for money and return a business benefit.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The value and cost of investments need to be measurable in objective terms. A government service that does not have an understood return on investment (ROI) is unlikely to receive the on-going support and commitment that will make it sustainable.&#xD;
•	Service delivery can create complicated cost/benefit models, particularly where there are cross-jurisdictional boundaries. The benefits realized through a service may not be recorded by the program and/or programs that are required to invest. A thorough understanding of the costs and benefits is required to establish an appropriate investment model to support the creation and on-going management of the service.&#xD;
•	It is mandatory for programs to meet the GC procurement rules for:&#xD;
    o	 value for money,&#xD;
    o	 encouraging competition,&#xD;
    o	efficient, effective and ethical use of resources, and&#xD;
    o	accountability and transparency.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Business initiatives will need to be fit for purpose and deliver value and benefit.&#xD;
•	Business initiatives will need to be prioritized in terms of their relation to the GC and department vision, policies, strategies and plans.&#xD;
•	The department will need to assess the ROI for each business initiative.&#xD;
•	Public ROI should be based on the department taking a rewards-based approach to ROI measurement and encompass the following three areas:&#xD;
    o	Financial ROI:  Traditional or “classic” measurement of financial gains with quantifiable results. These ROI is direct, measureable benefits and costs e.g., reduced transaction costs (such as in procurement by reducing the cost creating a purchase order from $28 to $21) or fewer steps in the workflow of approving a budget request&#xD;
    o	Social ROI:  Impact of government services on a societal level This ROI is indirect and difficult to measure public good benefits and costs e.g., are citizens safer? Are children in a particular jurisdiction receiving adequate social services? Are the vulnerable receiving sufficient support?&#xD;
    o	Political ROI: Impacts the system of governing and policy decision making. This ROI is motivational feasibility of the project, or the benefits of interested parties (champions, opponents, decision makers) e.g., are we delivering government programs that match policies, legislation and mandates? Are we delivering on the promises of our politicians?&#xD;
•	In addition to assessing the public ROI for each business initiative, a total cost of ownership (TCO) approach will be required. The TCO will need to assess the investment against other priorities, as well as balancing the costs of development, support, security, risk mitigation, disaster recovery and retirement against the costs of government’s requirements for flexibility, scalability, ease of use and reduction of integration complexity.&#xD;
•	There will need to be improved whole-of-government usage of business benefit management and benchmarking,&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Reliable&#xD;
Statement:	Departmental services are reliable, accurate, relevant and timely.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The take-up and use of lower cost channels will depend on users of government services trusting the ability of the government to provide reliable, accurate, relevant and timely information to consumers.&#xD;
•	Reliable services that provide consistent outcomes will help to reduce complaints, reviews and appeals from consumers.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	The department  will need to deliver services and information which clients can rely upon. &#xD;
•	 The department, and  programs will need to devote effort towards service design and service performance management to ensure reliable services&#xD;
•	Good processes create good services and data. Processes will need to be the focus of ongoing continuous improvement (which in turn will improve reliability, accuracy, relevancy and timeliness of the service). &#xD;
•	 The department will need to provide trusted services and information to individuals, and organizations. The outcomes of these services and information will strengthened the trust in the department and Government of Canada. &#xD;
•	The department and programs will  need to collaboration  with other departments and programs to deliver, manage and measure services to ensure the services are achieving the desired outcomes&#xD;

      <documentation>3.5.	Cohesiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Cohesiveness&#xD;
Statement:	Departments shall present a consistent and unified face of government through a common and integrated approach to service delivery.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Government services are presented to clients in a consistent and cohesive manner. This means that clients of government services should only need to present a piece of information to government once. Similarly, clients will be presented with a common look, feel and experience regardless of what department service or channel they are accessing at the time. This presentation of a consistent government face will reduce the impact of internal government change (for example, department/program amalgamations and restructures) on clients, and potentially reduce the flow on costs of such changes. Adoption and continued use of a service by clients will depend, to an extent, on ease of use enhanced by consistency of service delivery.&#xD;
•	With the introduction of common services and the reduction of duplicate services, the Government/Department has the opportunity to reduce costs.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Departments and Programs will need to collaborate in the development of services. This will require open sharing of information, cross-department/program planning, and understanding of whole-of-government service channels, segments and lines of business.&#xD;
•	To achieve consistent and interoperable service across the whole-of-government, the government, department and its programs will need to agree and use common technologies, open industry standards and open architectures.&#xD;
•	The department and programs will need to align service delivery with whole-of-government policies, strategies and frameworks.&#xD;
•	Departments and programs will need to reduce integration complexity.&#xD;
•	Departments and programs will need to incorporate the seamless use of interoperable applications, data and information across various sourcing models and operating environments.&#xD;

Name:	Accessible-by-Default&#xD;
&#xD;
Statement:	Information and data is open, accessible and easy to use by default, however protected within closed environments when it includes personally identify  and/or sensitive data &#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The Government of Canada strives to provide Canadians with access to the data that is produced, collected, and used by departments and agencies across the federal government through a single and searchable window.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are easily findable and consumable, in the appropriate format for a variety of users and scenarios.&#xD;
•	Benefits of open data include:&#xD;
    o	Support for innovation&#xD;
    o	Advancing the government's accountability and democratic reform &#xD;
    o	Leveraging public sector information to develop consumer and commercial products &#xD;
    o	Better use of existing investment in broadband and community information infrastructure &#xD;
    o	Support for research &#xD;
    o	Support informed decisions for clients &#xD;
    o	Proactive Disclosure&#xD;
•	Information and Data are ubiquitous, but to be of business value the constraints challenging its access and use must be mitigated as much as is appropriate to do so. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Unless sensitive or containing personally identifiable data, the data is accessible to all employees of ESDC.&#xD;
•	When designing services and systems, opportunities for publishing open data must be explored. Data can be published in different formats, or made accessible through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). &#xD;
•	Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide on-demand access to large, timely or complex data.&#xD;
•	Information and Data holdings must be aligned to business needs and functions.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are clearly catalogued, easily discoverable and easily accessible.&#xD;
•	Access must be closely tied to understanding of the data, otherwise inappropriate use may occur.&#xD;
•	Information and Data consumers’ awareness and education of data sources must be sustained.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are in the appropriate tool and format for use and users know how to access it.&#xD;
•	Efficient / timely access to information / data and its protection are not mutually exclusive concepts.&#xD;
•	Information and Data repositories need to be managed to reduce redundancies and duplication.&#xD;
•	Information and Data presentation must match generally accepted internal or external standards.&#xD;
•	Levels of aggregation or disaggregation are appropriate for consumption purposes.&#xD;
•	Timeliness of access permits the right data to be available when it is needed.&#xD;
•	Mashup of Information and Data will push the boundaries of user understanding and will need training and support.&#xD;
•	Knowledge repositories should capture enterprise information in ways to be useful as a basis for designing programs and services to improve future outcomes.&#xD;
•	Business and Information Professionals must partner to ensure user/consumer perspective is enabled.&#xD;
•	Information and data is now found in many forms and under many constraints.&#xD;
•	Boundaries or constraints can include legal, geographic, ownership, sovereignty, language, format, application, technology, security, privacy, etc.; the goal is to architect by considering these boundaries, not to circumvent them.&#xD;
•	Data architecture or lineage and flow must be such that we can utilize, process, and share data regardless of constraints.&#xD;
•	Data if possible should reside where it is and not re-created or moved.&#xD;
•	Intellectual property must be respected and maintained regardless of constraints.&#xD;
•	A federated management / stewardship approach may be applied in certain circumstances.&#xD;
•	Availability must not suffer due to insufficiently designed and implemented solutions.&#xD;
•	Third party processing (supply chain security) policies and architectures should be designed and monitored (i.e., our data must be under our rules at all times and locations).&#xD;

      <documentation>4.2.	Common Understanding and Trusted&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Common Understanding and Trusted&#xD;
Statement:	Business and program terminology and data are defined consistently throughout the Department, and the definitions and values are understandable, trusted and available to all users.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	A common vocabulary facilitates communications and enables effective dialogue.&#xD;
•	The data that will be used in the development of services must have a common definition throughout the Department to enable sharing of data. &#xD;
•	Information and Data are meaningfully defined from an enterprise perspective by the appropriate authorities, and are obtained from reliable, authoritative and understood data flows and sources. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	The Department must establish the initial common vocabulary for the business based on open standards where available. The definitions will be used uniformly throughout the Department.&#xD;
•	Multiple concurrent definitions must be replaced by a definition that is accepted and understood by the entire Department.&#xD;
•	Whenever a new definition is required, the definition effort will be co-coordinated and reconciled with the corporate &quot;glossary&quot;. &#xD;
•	Clarity and integrity of information / data is crucial to supporting business processes&#xD;
•	Building trust in data requires a multi-faceted approach.&#xD;
•	Metadata capture and utilisation must be mandatory in all processes and systems&#xD;
•	Data and its associated metadata must be an integral part of any business process design&#xD;
•	Information and data lineage (flow) and applied business rules must be documented and available&#xD;
•	Stewards must clearly define business terms and data elements, aligned to business programs to provide a common enterprise vocabulary, thus allowing for enterprise-wide use and interoperability&#xD;
•	Stewards need a simple and repeatable process to define, have approved and publish definitions and other metadata for information and data elements&#xD;
•	Stewards and all consumers need a repository, tied to important systems to capture / consume metadata &#xD;
•	Stewards will direct custodians in their activities as relates data aspects&#xD;
•	Properly identified data custodians are solely responsible for data capture to ensure integrity and quality and reduce redundant efforts and storage/processing&#xD;
•	Data governance and stewardship provide the means to ensure that enterprise data can be trusted &#xD;
•	Enterprise Information and Data should be located in authoritative sources &#xD;
•	Without trust in data consumers may develop their own siloed and redundant solutions/repositories.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Shared Assets&#xD;
Statement:	Information and Data are Shared Assets.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are valuable enterprise assets, with clear accountability, and treated as ‘our’ data not ‘my’ data to fully deliver on its benefits. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Information / Data are enterprise assets, much like capital, human or intellectual property assets.&#xD;
•	Most enterprise assets require careful management, and Information / Data are no exception.&#xD;
•	Information / Data assets exist to respond to business needs, support decision-making, enhance operational efficiencies and provide effective service delivery.&#xD;
•	Ownership resides at the enterprise level or higher, not at the individual or business line level.&#xD;
•	Clearly assigned stewardship is key to managing day-to-day data activities and data quality but requires the authority and the means to do so to ensure authoritative decisions are taken by the right parties.&#xD;
•	Discussion and decision forums and approaches must be inclusive, transparent, holistic and at the enterprise level and no longer strictly by business line or limited scope.&#xD;
•	Value is derived from sharing by reducing the number of authoritative sources, obliging data quality, permitting horizontal use / re-use and aggregation / dissemination to tap into unknown potential, and by allowing faster yet secured access.&#xD;
•	Managing and sharing requires policies, procedures, standards, roles &amp; responsibilities, to govern data management capabilities and a significant cultural change at all enterprise levels.&#xD;
•	Various artefacts and tools such as an enterprise data model and a business glossary will assist with management, communication and sharing in support of the enterprise mandate.&#xD;

Name:	Fit-for-Purpose&#xD;
Statement:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are Fit-for-Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are suitable and of the appropriate quality for the intended purpose, as defined by the business programs and tested as close to the source as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Often assumed to be a 100% data quality requirement and not the pragmatic reality.&#xD;
•	Approach should be to get the data ‘right’ for the need, as defined by the responsible party.&#xD;
•	Management and architecture of the information / data must support not only operational needs but also and analytical / research and marketing requirements, otherwise the data has no value in bettering program outcomes.&#xD;
•	Information and Data quality must be tested and remediated as close to the source as possible.&#xD;
•	Information and Data quality will degrade over time, even if nothing ‘happens’ to the actual data, therefore validation of its quality must be performed as an ongoing function, not one-time efforts and monitoring and reporting on quality metrics must be part of everyday operations.&#xD;
•	Data quality functional expertise (i.e., center of excellence) can establish a standardised framework and support to business programs in their quality validation processes.&#xD;
•	Dimensions of quality utilised to validate the appropriateness and usefulness of the data will vary by necessity (i.e., uniqueness, validity, completeness, accuracy, etc.).&#xD;
•	Business purpose of data must consider upstream and downstream uses, and not just the immediate use.&#xD;
•	Information and data repositories may need differing levels of quality if utilised for research versus operational needs.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name: 	Buy what we can and build what we must.&#xD;
Statement:&#xD;
Implement cloud services/COTS by default, open source where practical, and reserve custom development for unique requirements; adopt shared services and common government solutions where available.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Procuring commercial solutions (Cloud Services, COTS or open source) for common applications allows ESDC to focus its resources on application with Unique Requirements related specific configurations, customizations, and as a last resort custom development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	When deploying new workloads, Departments must consider cloud service models in the following order:&#xD;
    o	Cloud Services (SaaS)&#xD;
    o	Open source&#xD;
    o	COTS &#xD;
This means that the preference will be given to subscribing to SaaS solutions rather than buying or developing new solutions that can be hosted on a PaaS or IaaS infrastructure.&#xD;
•	When SaaS is not available, ESDC will explore availability of packaged solutions, both commercially available (COTS) and open source. Only if no appropriate solution is available on the market (commercial or open sauce), development of a custom solution would be considered.&#xD;
•	Proprietary solutions restrict reuse, reduce asset management flexibility and can prevent government organizations from switching suppliers.&#xD;
•	Open source will be fairly assessed against proprietary solutions alternatives. Exit, rebid and rebuild costs will be taken into consideration during procurement decisions for best value for money comparisons between open source and proprietary solutions.&#xD;

Statement:	The architecture is based on a design of services which mirror real-world business activities comprising the enterprise (or inter-enterprise) business processes.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Service orientation supports enterprise agility and boundaryless information flow&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;

•	Service representation utilizes business description to provide context (i.e. business process, goal, rule, policy service interface and service component) and implements services using service orchestration&#xD;
•	Service orientation places unique requirements on the infrastructure; implementations should use open standards to realise interoperability and location transparency.&#xD;
•	Implementations are environment specific; they are constrained by context and must be described within that context.&#xD;
•	Service orientation requires strong governance of service representation and implementation.&#xD;

Statement:	‘Right-size’ the variety of technology platforms to use in alignment with our partners’ strategic choices (i.e. SSC, TBS).&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Limiting the number of different supported technologies:&#xD;
    o	Improves maintainability and reduces total cost of ownership.&#xD;
    o	Enhances staff focus on standardized technologies and reduces staff competency requirements.&#xD;
    o	Improves solution interoperability&#xD;

&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Consider benefits of introducing a new technology versus the required additional maintenance effort, additional staff competency requirements, increased complexity, and the potential lack of interoperability with existing technologies.&#xD;
•	Balance controlling technical diversity and IT-enabled business innovation.&#xD;
•	Prefer vendor-independent technologies to enable solution interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in.&#xD;
•	Reduce integration complexity by utilizing standardized integration approaches.&#xD;
•	Policies, standards, and procedures that govern acquisition of technology must be tied directly to this principle.&#xD;
•	Technology options will be constrained by the choices available within the supported standards. &#xD;
•	Technology options and preferred choices are published as “Technology Bricks” and governed through architecture governance. The “Bricks” are refreshed regularly to reflect appearance of new technologies and sunset of legacy technologies.&#xD;

      <documentation>6.3.	Quality Level Metrics (QLM) Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	QLM Approach&#xD;
Statement:	Technology implementations require quality level metrics (QLM) negotiations and tradeoff discussions to occur as early as possible in the architecture and design process between business stakeholders and systems stakeholders including application architects, technology architects, service providers and operations and maintenance staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Facilitates non-functional requirements gathering &#xD;
•	Avoids narrow discussions of requirements - business stakeholders will have a clearer idea of the system they are asking for / getting &#xD;
•	Better acceptance from the business on the system that is ultimately delivered – fewer surprises for both the business and I&amp;IT &#xD;
•	Better fit of applications into the infrastructure &#xD;
•	Better security&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Security-by-Design&#xD;
Statement:	Enable and protect activities and assets of both people and enterprises are built-in to any business practice and corresponding IT solution&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	ESDC’s  IM/IT assets are protected against theft, loss, damage, or unauthorized modification, destruction or disclosure to assure public confidence in the Department. &#xD;
•	When security protection for confidentiality, availability and integrity are considered up front., it is more cost effective and results are more robust and resilient.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Controls for the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability must be designed into all aspects of solutions from initiation, not as an afterthought.  &#xD;
•	Security must be designed in the business processes within which an IT system will be used.&#xD;
•	ESDC’s business solutions must be compliant with the Privacy Act; MITS; ATIP policies; FAA, etc.&#xD;
•	Security requirements must be determined with all stakeholders. &#xD;
•	Business driven security requirements based on legislation, policies, and business needs must be supported. &#xD;
•	A consistent, trusted and effective security model must be developed for use across all applications, data, systems, and infrastructure.&#xD;
•	Security Assessment and Audit (SA&amp;A) , and Statement of Sensitivity (SoS) processes shall be used to identify threats and risks and select cost effective controls which meet control objectives. &#xD;
•	A Vulnerability Assessment (VA) process shall be used to identifying and quantifying vulnerabilities in a system. &#xD;
•	Program managers need to have business impact analysis and business continuity planning processes developed and implemented. &#xD;
•	Program managers need to be part of the process to conduct the business impact analysis and to select contingency and business continuity plans. &#xD;
•	Business impact analysis should be coordinated with value/risk analysis to identify potential countermeasures to exposures to the ESDC during the design of new business processes. &#xD;
•	A controlled variance process must be adhered to.&#xD;
•	Accountable parties are responsible for establishing or aligning to authorised purposes for their assets &#xD;
•	Risk tolerances, breach mitigation and breach outcomes must be clearly defined beforehand.&#xD;
•	Ethically and legally, ESDC is obligated to protect Information / Data under its care to retain the right to manage and use it.&#xD;
•	Information / Data are sheltered from unauthorised access, modification, use, disclosure or destruction.&#xD;
•	Intellectual property and confidentiality is safeguarded.&#xD;
•	Sharing must be balanced against classification, proprietariness or sensitivity of Information / Data.&#xD;
•	Aggregation of Information / Data, such as for residual data must also be reviewed for sensitivity.&#xD;
•	Security must be applied at the appropriate level, i.e., data level versus application level.&#xD;
•	Systems and Information / Data must be safeguarded from malevolent intentions and disaster.&#xD;
•	Emerging technologies such as cloud and data lakes, must be accounted for in modernised policies,  standards and practices, and user awareness and training.&#xD;
•	Anonymization or masking techniques may be necessary and utilised before permitting certain access.&#xD;
•	Security controls must not hinder appropriate and timely access and sharing of assets s (e.g.  Information / data).&#xD;
&#xD;
GC Security Architecture &#xD;
•	Information categorization – As the originator of a record, each department is responsible for a plan, the implementation of information categorization systems and the review of data and information prior to release on the Open Government Portal (the “Portal”)&#xD;
•	Should it be third-party information (government to government, government to industry, other), additional release mechanisms are up to department review &#xD;
•	Training and awareness on the requirements of the Portal is needed (to reduce additional work for other departmental stakeholders such as ATIP officer or Privacy analysts)&#xD;
•	Departments are also responsible to review the metadata and telemetry of datasets, to reduce the risk that combining smaller pieces of the data can enable a malicious user to action one of the risk scenarios&#xD;
•	Legal and policy framework – Departments must continue to observe all domestic and international laws as they relate to handling resources, and should be respectful when considering which resources are being shared and released on the Portal&#xD;
•	Respect for privacy and persons – Departments must protect personal information by not releasing it on the Portal&#xD;
•	Departments must ensure that all data and information released on the Portal contains no personal information or is properly de-identified/anonymized&#xD;
•	Departments should be transparent about how data and information will be collected, used and shared on the Portal&#xD;
•	Within an “Open by Default” environment, departments must identify situations and datasets which cannot be released or be made open by design&#xD;
•	Forward planning – Departments should consider privacy and security when releasing records on the Portal.  Considerations should include:&#xD;
•	Consulting internally with business line and data / information owners / stewards to identify risks associated to the public, the organizations and the government as a whole&#xD;
•	Assessing privacy and security on an ongoing basis, as due diligence does not end with uploading a record but rather an ongoing responsibility to maintain the accuracy and completeness of all records&#xD;
•	Making plans prior to the release of records for their maintenance and periodic reviews of the privacy and security implications of the universe of relevant records available on the Portal&#xD;
•	Assigning clear accountabilities within departments and agencies for considering privacy and security implications of open government records&#xD;
•	Security and Privacy Incidents and Remediation – Departments and agencies will take steps to ensure their ability to respond effectively in the case of a privacy or security incident&#xD;
•	In the event of any real or suspected security incidents, departments and agencies will respond in accordance with the Directive on Departmental Security Management (DDSM), departmental and agency processes and procedures, and when applicable the Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP)  &#xD;
•	In the event of any real or suspected privacy breach, departments and agencies will respond in accordance with the Directive on Privacy Practices. Departments and agencies should apprise themselves of TBS Guidelines for Privacy Breaches and the Privacy Breach Management Toolkit. These privacy instruments identify causes of privacy breaches, provide guidance on how to respond, contain and manage privacy breaches, delineate roles and responsibilities, and include links to relevant supporting documentation&#xD;
•	Considerations for maximizing release – When considering de-identifying information and data, the following should be noted:&#xD;
•	De-identification needs to be done by trained officials&#xD;
•	Software for de-identification is not always available and may need to be developed&#xD;
•	Effective de-identification may reduce the granularity of records and, as a result, data and information quality may decrease&#xD;
•	De-identification can be costly and require significant investments of resources, time, and data processing&#xD;
•	Extrapolation or aggregation risks may persist in spite of de-identification efforts&#xD;

      <documentation>7.3.	Integrity-by-Design&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Integrity-by-Design&#xD;
Statement:	Provide clients with a high degree of trust that the system and its attendant data and information are correct (i.e., precise, accurate and meaningful), valid (created, modified and deleted only by authorized users) and invariant (i.e., consistent an unmodified).&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Integrity is one of the three central pillars of securing corporate information assets along with confidentiality and availability. Integrity keeps data pure and trustworthy by protecting system and data from intentional or accidental changes. &#xD;
•	With data being the primary information asset, integrity provides the assurance that the data is accurate and reliable. Without integrity, the cost of collecting and maintaining the data cannot be justified. Therefore, policies and procedures should support ensuring that data can be trusted.&#xD;
•	Mechanisms put in place to ensure the integrity of the system, its data and information should prevent attacks on the storage of that data (contamination) and on its transmission (interference). Data that is altered on the network between the storage and the user's workstation can be as untrustworthy as the attacker altering or deleting the data on the storage media. Protecting data involves both storage and network mechanisms.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Unauthorized users must be prevented from making modifications to data or programs.&#xD;
•	Unauthorized users must be prevented from making improper or unauthorized modifications.&#xD;
•	Internal and external consistency of data and programs must be maintained.&#xD;
•	Applying encryption to information that will be sent over the Internet or stored on digital media.&#xD;
•	Software must be built defensively.&#xD;
•	Users should be prevented from inadvertently storing inaccurate or invalid data by incorrect data entry, an incorrect decision made in running programs, or not following procedures.&#xD;
•	Users should be prevented from affecting integrity through system configuration errors at their workstations or even by using the wrong programs to access the data.&#xD;
•	Users should be taught about devicde and data integrity during their information security awareness training.&#xD;
•	The installation of any new software or devices must be prevented except when done by a limited set of authorized people. &#xD;
•	Check system integrity against a set of predefined validation policies or standards.&#xD;

&#xD;
Proposed to BDM-ARC for endorsement (1-5 out of 10)&#xD;
1) BDM will implement a new Target Operating Model designed for the future. Transition will be gradual and iterative ensuring service continuity.&#xD;
2) BDM will consume a GC or ESDC enterprise solution/service where it exists and meets all BDM mandatory and majority of non-mandatory functional and non-functional requirements, as well as, when there is a commitment and plan for long-term investment in sustainment and support.&#xD;
3) BDM will favour investment in strategic solutions and technologies over investment in interim and tactical ones. &#xD;
4) Data is at the center of BDM. BDM embraces Data Management-by-design by building services and processes that support and enable appropriate data access, standards and quality for ESDC clients, partners and staff. BDM advocates leveraging data from an authoritative source. &#xD;
5) Digital First. BDM will design and implement digital interfaces to enable and encourage submission of information in a digital format through the digital channel and third-party systems and end-user applications.&#xD;
6) Open solutions by default, proprietary by exception. SaaS and COTS that support open standards are considered open solutions. Open source will be considered where appropriate. &#xD;
7) Balance Service and Security. Balance proactive and personalized Service Experience and Privacy.&#xD;
8) BDM will embed integrity and quality controls up-front and throughout processes and services. &#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="13. Adoption of Event-Driven Architecture" id="id-bf82dc1967484d9faa494d8861e7599d">
      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 13: &#xD;
Principle:	Adoption of Event-Driven Architecture&#xD;
Statement:	Preference will be given to event-driven architecture to help build decoupled, responsive, adaptive and resilient solutions.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Modernization of digital channels and services, as well as planned advances in service delivery and common benefit processing, require ability to access data and process events and transactions in (near) real time. Solutions and services need to be designed to “react to events” and process them in (near) real time where desirable and to the extent possible.&#xD;
This type of architecture adds a layer that further decouples architecture components, making the overall architecture more adaptive and resilient.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Key objective is to move from batch to predominantly (near) real-time services and transactions.&#xD;
•	Every integration should be considered for event driven approach. BDM will implement the most appropriate pattern for each integration with a view to move to event-driven integrations whenever this approach is aligned with the business processes the integration enables. &#xD;
•	We will assess supporting solutions and dependencies for their ability of being event driven and can participate without added complexity.&#xD;
•	Best practices and lessons learned from previous successful implementations of these technologies will be consulted prior to making the decision.&#xD;
•	We do not recommend “Everything is an Event” approach. Complementary integration patterns exist and will be considered for integrations that are not natively event-driven. Data integration technologies are available too!&#xD;
•	Selection and implementation of an Event Broker and Messaging Platform becomes high priority for Tranche 1.&#xD;
•	Caveat: Cùram SPM includes OOTB batch processes that need to be implemented as defined by the platform. No previous implementations of Cùram were based on event driven architecture.&#xD;
•	Caveat: This type of architecture requires highly-available and resilient network and infrastructure. Cost may increase.&#xD;
•	Caveat: Will require high transaction rate through SCED which raises performance and bandwidth concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
BDM EA WG: The principle is well received and supported by the architecture community. Despite caveats, this is a good principle to have to communicate desire to move from batch to predominantly real-time client services and transaction processing.&#xD;
Recommendation: Accept</documentation>

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 7: &#xD;
Principle:	Security and Privacy-by-Design. &#xD;
Statement:	Balance Service and Security. &#xD;
Balance Service and proactive and personalized Service Experience and Privacy.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Security measure can present constraints for data collection and client interaction. Similarly, proactive and personalized service requires collecting and analyzing client data and proactively initiating interactions with the client which can be viewed as at odds with respecting client’s privacy. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will seek to balance client and business needs with appropriate security measures. &#xD;
•	Evaluation of architectures and proposed solutions in regards to applicable and supported security measures will be presented to BDM-ARC.&#xD;
•	BDM will seek to reduce constraints related to data collection and data access and sharing, while maintaining a focus on privacy (e.g. leveraging a client consent-based model). &#xD;
•	Privacy considerations are key to legislation, operational policy, service and business rules design. Through architecture and solution design, BDM will ensure that their intent in regards to privacy is maintained in implementation.</documentation>

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 6: &#xD;
Principle:	Open Solutions and standards. &#xD;
Statement:	Open solutions by default, proprietary by exception. SaaS and COTS that support open standards are considered open solutions. Open source will be considered where appropriate. &#xD;
Rationale: 	In an ideal scenario, solutions (or their components) are interoperable and substitutable: each one can be substituted easily and independently. This can be achieved only when solutions support open standards. &#xD;
Implications:	•	Open standards and industry best practices are and will continue to be embedded in BDM architecture and functional and non-functional requirements.&#xD;
•	Proprietary solutions that do not support open standards or are not substitutable for any reason must be identified and granted an exception by BDM-ARC and EARB. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Note on open standards and open source software (Reference: Open Standards Whitepaper on GitHub):&#xD;
The following criteria define open standards:&#xD;
process for the standard's development is open and transparent to all interested parties and cannot be controlled by any single person or entity with any vested interests;&#xD;
platform independent, vendor neutral and usable for multiple implementations;&#xD;
specifications and supporting material are freely available with limited restrictions;&#xD;
supported by the community and demonstrate independence or approved through due process by rough consensus among participants.&#xD;
Open source software (OSS) is a way of developing and distributing software. The code is often written collaboratively, and it can be downloaded, used and changed by anyone.&#xD;
Open source software (OSS) and open standards are separate concepts, however there are strong ties between them. OSS tends to use and help define open standards and publicly available specifications. OSS are, by their nature, publicly available specifications, and the availability of their source code promotes open, democratic debate around their specifications, making them both more robust and interoperable. </documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="12. Maximize Use of Core Technology" id="id-d76ad2aae99f4e55a21c363fc13297b5">
      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 12: &#xD;
Principle:	Maximize Use of Core Technology&#xD;
Statement:	Consider leveraging capabilities and functionality of the Core Technology (Cùram Social Program Management) before considering other solutions and applications for common benefit processing and service delivery.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Leveraging investment in the platform and making use of OOTB business logic and processes will greatly improve ESDC agility and ability to implement new benefits and implement changes to existing benefits and processes.&#xD;
Additionally, this will reduce complexity of implementation and cost of ownership minimizing the need for integration with other dependant applications. &#xD;
Implications:	•	Business may have to accept that not all requirements will be fully met by the Core Technology solution. &#xD;
•	Design of some future state business processes may need to be adjusted to leverage OOTB business logic and processes.&#xD;
•	Evolving business needs may require moving away from specific capabilities of the Core Technology solution in the future. This situation would trigger changes in architecture, transition to either specialized best of breed or enterprise solutions and possibly procurement. Principle #11: Architecting for Agility mitigates this implication.&#xD;
•	Core Technology solution architecture becomes the architecture for the Common Benefit Delivery Platform.  &#xD;
•	Enables alignment of the BDM solution evolution and improvements with the Cùram Social Program Management product roadmap and plans for future improvements.&#xD;
•	Supports an MVP approach.&#xD;
•	Caveat: Increased risk of vendor lock-in.&#xD;

Rationale: 	Embedded approach to integrity and quality management is required to move away from “pay-and-chase” model and enable continuous service improvement. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will ease burden of proof on clients, based on risk and complexity profile, while maintaining compliance and integrity checks.  &#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 9: &#xD;
Principle:	Cloud First. &#xD;
Statement:	Cloud First. BDM will leverage cloud where appropriate and available.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Cloud computing means providing infrastructure services and application services on demand. This is made possible through a high level of virtualization of hardware components by way of infrastructure service software. The result is highly scalable, elastic, available and programmable infrastructure. All these characteristics are of great importance to BDM. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will leverage cloud where applicable, available and where it meets BDM security requirements. &#xD;
•	All cloud deployment options (including SaaS) will be explored and evaluated as part of the solution design.&#xD;

Statement:	Digital First. BDM will design and implement digital interfaces to enable and encourage submission of information in a digital format through the digital channel and third-party systems and end-user applications.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM target state characteristics include digitally enabled services and responsive, proactive and inclusive service experience. BDM goals, among others, include:&#xD;
•	empowering clients to self-serve by providing an attractive, seamless and end-to-end service delivery option through the digital channel;&#xD;
•	leveraging the support of NGOs, public and private sector partners to optimize and deliver a better, more impactful client outcomes.&#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will design and implement new digital channel solutions that will enable seamless and accessible client self-service.&#xD;
•	Functionality will be exposed as services via APIs where applicable and of business value.&#xD;
•	BDM will encourage and work with service delivery partners to change their existing systems or develop new end-user applications for their staff and clients to submit data to ESDC in a digital format.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 1: &#xD;
Principle:	New Target Operating Model and service continuity during the transition &#xD;
Statement:	BDM will implement a new Target Operating Model designed for the future. Transition will be gradual and iterative ensuring service continuity.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM service modernization and service ambitions cannot be realized with technology modernization only – a new Operating Model is required. BDM will modernize services that deliver over $122B annually to Canadians, many of which are mission critical as they support most vulnerable clients in the time of need. Disruption to the delivery of these services is unacceptable.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Architectures and solutions proposed as strategic and target state will be evaluated against the new Target Operating Model.&#xD;
•	To ensure service continuity, co-existence model where new solutions and legacy operate in parallel will be required. &#xD;
•	Co-existence model inherently leads to a greater complexity than the current or target state. Among different viable architectures that are fit to support the new Target Operating Model and co-existence, less complex ones will be favoured over more complex options.&#xD;
•	Evaluation of  architectures and proposed solutions in regards to their ability to integrate and operate in a co-existence model will be presented to BDM-ARC.</documentation>

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 11: &#xD;
Principle:	Architecting for Agility&#xD;
Statement:	BDM solutions will be architected for agility, creating modular and flexible architecture and reducing risks of vendor lock-in. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Architecting for agility is a fundamental shift in delivering IT services, moving away from operational inefficiencies to flexible, decoupled solutions. It will position ESDC to adapt to technology changes and ever-changing client and business needs and expectations.&#xD;
Our objective is to create a flexible and resilient BDM architecture that enables agility to continuously innovate. An architecture that has greater agility will enable ESDC to have a more fluid and flexible technology landscape, setting us up to be more responsive and adaptable to future changes.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Platforms and products that consist of individually deployable modules will be preferred over monolithic solutions.&#xD;
•	Solutions and modules will be decoupled whenever possible without causing performance or latency issues.&#xD;
•	Architecture decisions will be made just in time to enable procurement and implementation. Making them too early may create undesirable constraints on the scope and technology options.&#xD;
•	BDM will consider alternatives and keep them &quot;open&quot; as long as they remain viable. It should be recognized that not all technical decisions can be made at the same time: there is benefit to making some decisions later when they can be better informed by business decisions and through additional analysis and prototyping. &#xD;
•	BDM will be prepared to refactor (change) architecture. Architecture work products will evolve and be further developed throughout the BDM Programme lifecycle. We will iterate and improve architecture periodically and as needed.&#xD;
•	BDM will identify and analyze architectural dependencies and incorporate them into a responsive model: we will strive to integrate dependencies through loose coupling and have contingency plan when they are yet to be implemented.&#xD;
•	Caveat: This principle will compete with Principle #3: Favour strategic over interim and tactical solutions. Tactical solutions may be necessary to help us achieve desired level of agility.&#xD;

Rationale: 	Data has a great potential to support and inform better decisions both in service design and continuous improvement and in adjudicating and processing client applications and requests. To realize such potential, data needs to be relevant, reliable and available.  &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will strive to enable data driven approach to decision making in service design and continuous improvement .&#xD;
•	BDM will enable data-as-a-service approach by enabling access to authoritative sources of data whenever possible. &#xD;
•	Data gathered once.&#xD;
•	Collecting the same data from the client multiple times for the use in different programs will be avoided.&#xD;
•	Transferring and replicating data will be done judiciously and only when necessary for functional or performance reasons.  &#xD;
•	Proposed data architectures, models and data flows will be presented to BDM-ARC for review.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 2: &#xD;
Principle:	BDM will consume GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services where appropriate and available.&#xD;
Statement:	BDM will consume a GC or ESDC enterprise solution/service where it exists and meets all BDM mandatory and majority of non-mandatory functional and non-functional requirements, as well as, when there is a commitment and plan for long-term investment in sustainment and support.&#xD;
Rationale: 	With each decision to leverage an existing solution or service, BDM will inherit risks associated with the architecture, deployment, availability and operations of the solution/service. Solutions and services which may have not been designed for the scale required by BDM or lack appropriate investment commitments, product roadmaps and operational and support models, present a risk to the BDM Programme. &#xD;
Implications:	•	GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services will be evaluated against BDM requirements. If gaps are identified, it is expected that an investment and a project plan are put in place to close the gaps. &#xD;
•	The architecture of the GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services will be evaluated for alignment and compatibility with the BDM solution architecture. &#xD;
•	BDM may present opportunities to enhance or modernize certain enterprise solutions and services. Such opportunities will be identified as architecture options and presented to BDM-ARC.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 3:&#xD;
Principle:	Favour strategic over interim and tactical solutions.&#xD;
Statement:	BDM will favour investment in strategic solutions and technologies over investment in interim and tactical ones. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Strategic solutions and technologies are those that are selected and deployed with a plan to support service delivery over a long term (10+ years). Tactical and interim solutions are both expected to be replaced by Strategic solutions, either in a relatively short time period (tactical) or over longer term (interim). &#xD;
Implications:	•	Investments in interim and tactical solutions, unless required for legislative, significant business value/savings or service continuity reasons, will be presented as architecture options with generally lower score for EA alignment than strategic solutions.&#xD;
•	BDM will support investments in interim and tactical solutions that are expected to deliver immediate business outcomes when they do not constitute an obstacle to the BDM implementation or significantly increase BDM technical debt. We advise to establish and monitor metrics for identified business outcomes throughout the lifecycle of the investment.&#xD;
•	Architecture of the interim or tactical solution may be reviewed if the solution needs to integrate with the BDM solution or support BDM implementation, for instance, by generating data and insights that would inform BDM service design and/or architecture.</documentation>

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 10: &#xD;
Principle:	Minimize changes to legacy. &#xD;
Statement:	Minimize changes and write-back to legacy. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Co-existence model inherently leads to significant complexity. BDM needs to design deployment strategy, transition architecture, services, processes and integration between new solutions and legacy to control complexity and risk. One of the approaches to control complexity is to minimize changes to legacy.&#xD;
Implications:	Architecture objectives and planning assumptions (to be validated through prototyping):&#xD;
•	There will be one system of record for each transaction.&#xD;
•	Transactions will be process either in the new or legacy system, not in both.&#xD;
•	Data will be accessed in the other system as needed.&#xD;
•	Certain amount of data will be migrated to the new system.&#xD;

Principle:	Outcome-driven (proposed by business architecture)&#xD;
Statement:	Architectural decisions will seek to maximize value to clients, partners, staff, ESDC, and the GoC driven by the overall Programme strategy.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM will seek to realize benefits for clients, partners, staff, ESDC, and the GoC.  Decisions regarding the architecture of BDM should be primarily focused on delivering on the outcomes outlined in the strategy.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Decisions regarding the technical and solution architecture should be weighed against their ability to achieve strategic outcomes and impact on the targeted stakeholders&#xD;

Government of Canada Digital Standards: Playbook&#xD;
From Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat&#xD;
&#xD;
Improving government services in the Digital Age&#xD;
Our goal is to provide public services to Canadians which are simple to use and trustworthy. The Government of Canada’s Digital Standards form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
These digital standards were co-created with the public and key stakeholder groups. They are living standards and they will continue to evolve over time as we better understand the complexities involved in putting them into practice.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Design With Users" id="id-9237c3a7c94a4f6ebb51cd47b1e5157b">
      <documentation>Design with users&#xD;
Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Design with users&#xD;
Services should not be built based on internal constraints or complexities of government, they should be built to address the needs of users. In order to deliver value to users, one must understand and prioritize their needs. Everything is a hypothesis until tested with the users of services.&#xD;
&#xD;
To validate one's hypotheses, one must validate their assumptions through direct and frequent interactions with those who will be using the services. Users may be members of the public, or government employees or a combination thereof. Keeping in mind that users will come from diverse backgrounds, varying in location, experience, knowledge, and abilities, requirements for services are built first and foremost with the needs of all users. When designing services, one must take a holistic approach to service delivery -- from each member's individual contributions to the end goal, as defined by user requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. End-user feedback is used to establish the requirements of our service(s).&#xD;
2. Our team has processes or tools in place for user feedback, including anonymous user feedback, to be incorporated into the design of the service.&#xD;
3. Our team conducts user research prior to deciding upon a given implementation. &#xD;
4. Our team has tested our primary systems in the users’ context with a wide range of users including users with varying needs and representing diverse backgrounds.&#xD;
5. Our team considers user needs and feedback in defining key service metrics.&#xD;
6. Our team uses automation to anticipate and detect operational or quality-of-service issues before our users tell us.&#xD;
7. Our team has within it, or direct access to, the expertise required to conduct user research and usability testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team receives requirements through extensive documentation and builds against them.&#xD;
2. Our team does not involve internal or external users to collaborate on the design of the service.&#xD;
3. The technical development resources or IT senior management are prioritizing features.&#xD;
4. Our team's prioritization of tasks is driven by senior management.&#xD;
5. Senior executives and teams rely exclusively on desk-based research, or other proxy sources of information to inform policy, program and/or service design.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Iterate and Improve Frequently" id="id-5073e95c58cc4d859539977398ba388a">
      <documentation>Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
In contrast to high risk and long lead time ‘big bang’ deployments, working services must be put in the hands of users as early as possible to get rapid feedback. Said feedback is then used to iterate upon to improve the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
One sets a north star to define a clear direction, then begins iterating towards this north star, keeping in mind that the path is not clear, and unexpected circumstances will require adjustments to be made along the way. By leveraging modern technologies and modern approaches to working, risk can be reduced by limiting the size of changes and increasing their frequency. Processes should empower teams to deliver value to services as often as possible, rather than increase risk by creating prolonged processes that use documentation in place of demonstrably functioning software. Focus on working software over comprehensive documentation and remember that perfect is the enemy of good.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. There are processes in place to prioritize and implement feedback from peers, stakeholders and end-users.&#xD;
2. When a new or updated service or feature is being created our team understands the minimum requirements for the system to be of value to users.&#xD;
3. Our team experiments with new approaches based on team reflections, lessons learned, and user feedback.&#xD;
4. Our team collects metrics to improve upon which are used throughout the development and lifecycle of the service.&#xD;
5. When resolving problems our team dedicates time to identify the root cause of the issue and address it.&#xD;
6. Our team is relentlessly inspecting, adapting, and automating their processes to increase the speed at which our team can deliver value to users.&#xD;
7. Our team has access to environments and resources to allow for rapid prototyping while initial requirements are being sought.&#xD;
8. Our team embraces learning about and using new digital skills, approaches, and tools to incorporate into our daily work.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team only shares their work once it has been finalized and approved.&#xD;
2. Decisions regarding the direction of our team are made without reference to any collected performance metrics.&#xD;
3. Our team identifies solutions before it is clear what outcomes our team is working towards and how to measure them.&#xD;
4. Processes are rarely, if ever, reviewed to find and implement efficiencies.&#xD;
5. Our team must wait for the project to be approved and funded prior to environments being made available to teams to begin experimenting with solutions.&#xD;
6. Our team fully architects the end to the service delivery solution prior to starting to build.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Work In The Open By Default" id="id-d5f2ada307704ba69329e4a6a90d1058">
      <documentation>Work in the open by default&#xD;
Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Work in the open by default&#xD;
Working in the open increases the transparency of services, increases trust in government, creates an ecosystem that promotes innovation, prevents needing to reinvent the wheel by increasing collaboration within, and external to, government. Working in the open promotes understanding of government processes and services and creates an environment whereby innovation can take place throughout the Government of Canada and through non-governmental organizations leveraging the government data and information to improve service delivery for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
This way of working aligns Canada with the Digital Nations Charter, of which it is a signatory and promotes “transparency and citizen participation and uses open licences to produce and consume open data”, and the Open Data Charter. Further, by working in the open the Government of Canada can increase its reuse of existing public solutions and allow others to reuse work conducted by the Government of Canada. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Teams continually makes all non-sensitive and non-personal data, information, and new code publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, for sharing and reuse.&#xD;
2. Our team contributes back to the public projects from which they borrow content.&#xD;
3. Our team tracks and makes public the metrics upon which our team measures its success.&#xD;
4. Our team tracks, and makes publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, information regarding how often a change to our services fails (e.g., the deployment or rollout of a service or feature experiences issues or complications).&#xD;
5. Our team makes visual displays which show what they’re working on and the status of their work available publicly, or at least throughout the Government of Canada.&#xD;
6. Our team publicly documents, including examples of reuse, how others can use their service’s APIs, open data, or information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. All of the team's work is done on systems behind the corporate firewall.&#xD;
2. The work of our team has permissions set so that only members of our team can access the team's work.&#xD;
3. Our team does not contribute to, or collaborate on, work being done by our colleagues.&#xD;
4. Team applies blanket security classification for the digital system to all data stored by the application.&#xD;
5. Our team has no process by which to declassify and release records when they are no longer protected or classified.&#xD;
6. The documentation for our APIs is only available to internal approved consumers.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Use Open Standards and Solutions" id="id-881d110ef6ec40b8b8ab6807a70d9440">
      <documentation>Use open standards and solutions&#xD;
Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices, including the use of open source software where appropriate. Design for services and platforms that are seamless for Canadians to use no matter what device or channel they are using.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Use open standards and solutions&#xD;
To maintain the trust of Canadians, the government must continually learn and improve by embracing leading practices to simplify access to government services to match the rising expectations of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
In alignment with the Digital Nations Charter, which calls for both the use of Open Standards and Open Source, this Digital Standard aligns with the ultimate Digital Vision which reads, “The Government of Canada is an open and service-oriented organization that operates and delivers programs and services to people and businesses in simple, modern and effective ways that are optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere and from any device.” By leveraging open source software, and leveraging open standards and solutions, the Government of Canada can mitigate vendor lock-in and expand its vendor pool from which to acquire digital services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team prioritizes solutions using open standards over solutions that do not.&#xD;
2. Team members give back to the open source community as active contributors.&#xD;
3. Our team designs their services to be interoperable with other services.&#xD;
4. When searching for a new product, service or solution, our team considers open source solutions.&#xD;
5. Our team supports clients using any device, from anywhere and at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team renews existing contracts with vendors without first investigating open source tooling.&#xD;
2. Our team does not have the competencies within it to deliver its services without the help of consultants or closed source vendor software.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Address Security and Privacy Risks" id="id-e52aaffc44144a7dad5322348bb855d6">
      <documentation>Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. Make security measures frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Digital services are core to service delivery, and they must securely store and manage the information of Canadians to maintain trust in government services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Security and privacy should be taken as a consideration from the onset of work for a given service, in alignment with Iterate and Improve. The implementation of security and privacy controls should be considered part of daily work. Similarly, processes should promote and monitor the continuous implementation of security and privacy controls throughout the lifecycle of a service. This will demonstrably increase the security and privacy posture of digital services by leveraging automated testing and real time reporting and monitoring over anecdotal document-heavy manual processes. Said processes, and the security and privacy controls themselves, should be frictionless, ensuring that services are designed first and foremost for users, not to satisfy existing legacy government procedures, tooling, or processes. Furthermore, by creating frictionless processes and permitting services to be iterated and improved upon quickly, the government is better situated to respond quickly to security or privacy risk. By responding to these operational needs within hours or minutes rather than months, the government can improve its security and privacy posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team considers security and privacy throughout the service design process.&#xD;
2. When implementing or enforcing security or privacy controls, our team takes into consideration how they would impact the quality or efficiency of the service and how it will impact the end users of the service.&#xD;
3. Security measures are frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
4. Our team has privacy and security knowledge and understanding as a competency within the team.&#xD;
5. The service has implemented automated security checks and privacy protections include role-based access and audit functions against the service.&#xD;
6. There are procedures and processes in place to quickly respond to security or privacy breaches or incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Team has no internal privacy or security knowledge, relying on other teams to identify nearly all security or privacy controls and best practices.&#xD;
2. The core services upon which our team works have no automated security checks or privacy protections.&#xD;
3. Our team relies on security through obscurity, hiding services or information rather than improving the security posture of the service.&#xD;
4. Our team implements or enforces security or privacy controls without considering the impact on service usability.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Build In Accessibility From the Start" id="id-1e8f784a84534bd1ab922a054229fb95">
      <documentation>Build in accessibility from the start&#xD;
Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Build in accessibility from the start&#xD;
Quality should be built in from the start, preventing the need to revisit previously implemented components due to issues, such as accessibility. The faster and earlier issues are found the less costly they are to fix.&#xD;
&#xD;
Accessibility in Canada is about creating communities, workplaces and services that enable everyone to participate fully in society without barriers. The Government of Canada is committed to taking a proactive and systemic approach for identifying, removing and preventing barriers to accessibility without delay complementing the rights of persons with disabilities under the Canadian Human Rights Act. To meet these commitments, accessibility should be a consideration throughout the service development lifecycle. This requires that accessibility be monitored and built into our processes to continually promote alignment with accessibility standards. While iterating and improving frequently and designing with users, accessibility should be a key consideration, and become a source of work items throughout the service design lifecycle. When designing with users, efforts should be made to identify a wide variety of users with a wide variety of needs, to ensure accessibility standards are met or exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Starting at the outset, our team's service and platform design continually considers the lowest levels of digital skill, confidence and access.&#xD;
2. Our team understands how to make their services or products accessible.&#xD;
3. Our team considers accessibility throughout the service design process.&#xD;
4. Research and testing are conducted to ensure our service is accessible to people of all abilities no matter how, where, or when they access the service.&#xD;
5. Our team conducts ongoing user research with users with low level digital literacy, people with disability, and people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.&#xD;
6. Our team implements automated accessibility checks for our services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team has no competency with accessibility and relies on another team to identify accessibility shortcomings.&#xD;
2. Accessibility compliance is added at the end of the development cycle in order to pass compliance checks or audits.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Empower Staff to Deliver Better Services" id="id-eff823450c1742e0a60ad939dd26ad53">
      <documentation>Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
Make sure that staff have access to the tools, training and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build and operation of the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
To promote innovation and create agility within our organizations the teams that makeup our organizations must be empowered. Innovation increasingly flows from the bottom up rather than from the top down, and to benefit from this trend teams must be empowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Don’t hire good people to tell them what to do, hire good people to have them tell you what to do. The government manages large, highly complex and crucially important services for their users. A top-down command and control approach to service delivery and designs enforces a structure that aligns to the structure itself, rather than to the needs of the users, or based on the expertise of those building the services. Rather than bringing information to authority, bring authority to the information. Those best suited to solve a given problem, are those closest to the problem. By removing decision-making authority from the teams into complex governance structures, the innovative potential of teams is mitigated by legacy governance procedures and processes. To create organizations that can iterate and improve frequently, teams must be empowered to make decisions for themselves. Complex architectures that are responsive to the needs of users, including users within the organization, are emergent and are not derived through the compilation of hypotheses lacking the expertise of those closest to the complex problems needing to be solved. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Team members self-organize and self-manage through self-assigning tasks.&#xD;
2. Team members meet with liberty to openly discuss challenges without fear of blame or reproach.&#xD;
3. Team members feel safe to challenge the status quo.&#xD;
4. Our team values learning as part of daily work.&#xD;
5. Team members can articulate how their work contributes to business outcomes.&#xD;
6. Our team can choose the tools they use to deliver their service.&#xD;
7. Our team's management actively removes impediments that prevent the team from focusing on delivering value.&#xD;
8. Our team has access to environments to experiment with new approaches, tooling, or solutions.&#xD;
9. Our team feels their feedback is valued.&#xD;
10. Failures are treated in our team as opportunities to improve and learn.&#xD;

Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Work is assigned directly to members of our team from management.&#xD;
2. Our team is required to get a series of approvals prior to being able to make routine changes to their service.&#xD;
3. Learning in our team is largely done through week or day long courses periodically throughout the year.&#xD;
4. Our team is unable, or finds it difficult, to acquire productivity tooling.&#xD;
5. Our team does not have access to Software as a Service (SaaS) productivity tools as they are blocked by the department.&#xD;

      <documentation>Be good data stewards&#xD;
Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held in a secure way so that it can easily be reused by others to provide services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Be good data stewards&#xD;
Good data stewardship is required to ensure data is clean, reusable, and managed responsibly to be leveraged for data driven decision making and promote reuse of information rather than duplication of efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
This involves managing data and information responsibly and securely, which supports the sharing and reuse of data throughout the Government of Canada and through promoting its use through innovative new solutions within the private sector. In alignment with working in the open by default, data and information should be published to be readable, by humans or by machines by publishing well organized data in machine readable formats. In alignment with iterating and improving frequently, efforts should be made to continually improve the quality of the data, and the quality of the processes used to manage and publish said data. Further, by working in the open by default and properly managing data and information sources, issues such as duplication of data and information and rework can be mitigated, while promoting the creation of innovative solutions which are able to leverage information collected and published by the government. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team strives to leverage data to continuously improve decision-making, operations, or service delivery.&#xD;
2. Our team identifies what data is needed to support decision-making, operations, or service delivery and reuses existing data as appropriate before acquiring new data.&#xD;
3. Our team strives to identify and remove barriers to data sharing and release.&#xD;

      <documentation>Design ethical services&#xD;
Make sure that everyone receives fair treatment. Comply with ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems which automate decision making (such as the use of artificial intelligence).&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Design ethical services&#xD;
Designing ethical systems means that systems created by the government ensures that everyone receives equitable treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Services should address client needs and provide public benefits. In the digital age, the underlying systems that run Canada’s services come to conclusions that can be opaque to both the external users, and those managing the systems. Efforts are required to increase the transparency and address potential biases of computational decisions, and to ensure that decisions made or supported using these systems are legal, consistent, accurate and align with the expectations and intents of those managing them. The responsible use of automated-decision systems includes being open about their use and being able to explain how decisions are made. Through iterative service design where results are continuously monitored against expected and desired outcomes, the organization positions itself to ensure it is designing ethical services. Furthermore, with extensive monitoring solutions, one must ensure their services are not enforcing biases, whether conscious or unconscious. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team continually seeks out indicators of bias and ensures their services are not reinforcing unintended biases.&#xD;
2. Our team continually seeks out evidence of unintended consequences to the user in service design and delivery and works to mitigate these consequences for the user.&#xD;
3. When automated decision-making is being leveraged by our team, possible biases in the data and algorithms are acknowledged, accounted for, and mitigated.&#xD;
4. Our team designs services which address cultural, linguistic, geographical, disability, technological, socioeconomic, or other access barriers to uptake.&#xD;
5. Our team has considered the impacts of decisions on the users and negative outcomes are reduced, when encountered.&#xD;
6. Our team uses data in a manner consistent with the purpose of its collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. No training is provided to our team regarding the potential impacts of the service they are designing or delivering.&#xD;
2. Our team conducts little to no monitoring of outcomes of the service to identify implicit bias.&#xD;
3. Our team delegates ethical analysis to a vendor or external service, without direct accountability to management.&#xD;
4. Our team designs and deliver services without fully considering relevant legislation&#xD;
5. Our team delivers services without assessing the impacts of negative outcomes.</documentation>

      <documentation>Collaborate widely&#xD;
Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Collaborate widely&#xD;
Collaborating widely allows us to learn from others to minimize mistakes already experienced and reduces work through identifying and sharing existing solutions. The problems that government solves are often unique, though they are not unique amongst governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Many of the same solutions by the same, or similar vendors, are used throughout the world, or at varying levels of government within different jurisdictions. When designing a service, or implementing a service using tools or systems, identify which other departments, jurisdictions, or organizations, have leveraged similar technologies to solve similar use cases in order to collaborate widely, reduce work, share solutions, and benefit from lessons already learned by others. Furthermore, using multidisciplinary teams, especially when coupled with the empowerment of staff, the government improves its posture to deliver modern and innovative services. Through wide collaboration, organizations begin to break down the silos developed over time through the overreliance on functionally based teams. Going forward, working across skill sets, and leveraging work from others, while learning from their lessons, promotes the development of modern services better able to meet the changing needs of citizens in the digital age.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team is multidisciplinary, having all the skills and capabilities required to fully deliver our service to users.&#xD;
2. Our team is active in communities of practice, events, or groups that pertain to the areas of expertise of team members.&#xD;
3. Our team has identified, and collaborates with, other teams, in or outside of our organisation, including other levels of government, other governments, the public, or private sector organizations, who have done, or are doing, similar work.&#xD;
4. Our team documents any APIs for our service using modern and common protocols and standards and provides examples to others regarding their use.&#xD;
5. Our team uses data from performance monitoring tools to inform business decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team develops most of the service on our own, without leveraging existing solutions and services to reduce duplication of effort.&#xD;
2. Our team overwhelmingly relies on tickets to manage collaboration between internal stakeholders or teams.&#xD;
3. The team does not consider the impacts on teams working across the value stream, or on the outcome of the service.</documentation>

      <documentation>1.2.	What are Principles?&#xD;
Architecture principles are a set of statements that inform architecture decisions (e.g. “Doing the Right Thing”) and work (e.g. “Doing EA  Right”). &#xD;
&#xD;
Bizbok and  TOGAF,  define principles as:&#xD;
•	An agreed upon truth that can guide one’s reasoning. (Bizbok 7.5 glossary)&#xD;
•	EA principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission (TOGAF 9.2 Chapter 20.1).&#xD;
To that end the essence of ESDC EA Principles are:&#xD;
•	EA Assement Principles: “Doing the Right Thing” inform architecture decisions to ensure  the department is doing the right thing to acheive its strategic goals and act on its mandate.  &#xD;
•	EA Program Principles: “Doing EA Right”,  inform architure work to ensure architectures are being developed and implemented the correct way.  (e.g TOGAF EA Principles, GC Architectural Standards)&#xD;
&#xD;
In general, the EA Principles are high-level statements of the fundamental values that guide business and IM/IT decision-making. EA Principles the foundation for architectures, policies, standards and processes. Because the EA Principles define a value system, once they are defined and agreed upon, they are not likely to change frequently; however they will be reviewed on an annual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
To be effective, EA Principles must be considered as a set, not individually. It is common to have sets of principles form a hierarchy in those more detailed principles are informed by and elaborate on the principles at a higher level.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Enterprise Architecture Principles are comprised of:&#xD;
    o	Domain Architecture Principles (Business, Information and Data, Application, Technology, Security &amp; Privacy) &#xD;
    o	Reference Architecture Principles&#xD;
    o	Security Architecture Principles&#xD;
    o	Solution Architecture Principles&#xD;
        	Design Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
ESDC Enterprise Architecture Principles are informed and constrained by the Government of Canada and the ESDC Service Strategy principles. Employment and Social Development Canada’s Service Strategy Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
1.5.	Value of EA Principles&#xD;
The EA Principles are intended to simplify, not complicate business decisions. They are most valuable in evaluating complex situations with multiple competing goals and where no clear rules or directives have been established. Conformance to the EA Principles as outlined in this document will:&#xD;
•	Optimize business value and departmental benefits realization;&#xD;
•	Provide a framework for assessing and prioritizing changes;&#xD;
•	Allow for change to be accommodated in a less disruptive manner;&#xD;
•	Facilitate the fulfilment of the business requirements;&#xD;
•	Lower the overall life cycle cost of applications;&#xD;
•	Improve the manageability of the architectural components;&#xD;
•	Support an active vs. reactive approach to planning service delivery projects.</documentation>

Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.</documentation>

Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.</documentation>
