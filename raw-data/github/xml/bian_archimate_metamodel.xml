			<documentation xml:lang="en">A ServiceDomain represents an atomic logical design.  
Atomic means that a BIAN Service Domain represents the smallest practical capability or functional partition that can be service-enabled as a discrete and unique business capability. 

All BIAN Service Domains taken together make up a peer set with each performing its own specific business function or purpose.  BIAN arranges this collection of Service Domains into a reference framework called the BIAN Service Landscape.
A ServiceDomain owns a set of ServiceGroups, each of which owns a set of ServiceOperations.  A ServiceDomain also owns a BusinessObject called its focusObject.

BIANBusinessAreas are used to decompose the functions of financial institutions. This decomposition is primarily driven by business understanding and complemented by application and information-specific needs.
Comments
    "BIAN" was added to the name of this class in order to make its distinction from ISO20022 MessageComponent obvious, but it was not strictly necessary for disambiguation since two UML classes can have the same unqualified name as long as they are in separate packages.  Note that, unlike other cases where "BIAN" has been added to the name of an element of the BIAN Metamodel to distinguish the element from an ISO 20022 element, in this case BIANBusinessArea is not a subtype of ISO 20022's BusinessArea element; ISO 20022 BusinessAreas are normatively defined by ISO and have a certain structure defined by the ISO 20022 Metamodel, whereas BIANBusinessAreas are non-normatively defined by BIAN as a vehicle -- along with BusinessDomains -- for organizing the BIAN Service Domains; conformance with BIAN does not require adopting BIAN's specific hierarchy of BIANBusinessAreas and BusinessDomains, said hierarchy being merely a reference model.
    
    BIAN has identified (amongst others) the following BIANBusinessAreas as part of BIAN's reference model of business areas and business domains: ○
    Reference Data○
    Sales &amp; Service○
    Operations &amp; Execution○
    Analytics○
    Business Support
    BusinessAreas are decomposed (i.e. subdivided) into Business Domains.
    BusinessAreas are part of the Service Landscape of BIAN.

Comment: 
It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position .
The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,
Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.
A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash , there is
a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased)
an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased)

An account can be assign to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly wel assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.

Examples: 
stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...
Bank Account BE12 1234 5678 9012 : is an individual banking account
Accounts Payable , is a collective account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to suppliers . This account is managed usually in a General Ledger 
Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a sub-ledger.
Stock Account x , is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts in stock of a specific good.

Comment
BIAN has defined the likely assets found in any bank and uses this approach to isolate the specific types of asset that are acted on by the ServiceDomains. The role or purpose of each and every ServiceDomain is to apply its specific functional pattern to instances of one type of asset.
Is the tangible or intangible item that can have associated 'replacement' value/worth and purpose/use for which the bank has ownership or some level of control. It is exploited/leveraged in the execution of business through the application of some business behavior/control as effected by a ServiceDomain. Some asset types are obvious - for example a machine or building, some are intangible but easily identified such as knowhow, knowledge, relationships, reputation. Some are less obvious - most common is the 'capacity to perform' type which applies to many BIAN Service Domains. For example in the case of product fulfillment and support activities like party authentication the asset is the bank's possession of the capacity to perform these activities - the combination of the people/processes/systems to execute if you will...

			<documentation xml:lang="en">The specification of a behavior that qualifies (i.e. refines) the generic behaviors defined for a ServiceDomain
Comment
Generic behaviors for a ServiceDomain are generated according to the ServiceDomain's FunctionalPattern. A ServiceDomain has a generic ServiceOperation corresponding to each of its generic, FunctionalPattern-based behaviors. BehaviorQualifiers are used to define additional ServiceOperations.
Example
Consider the ServiceDomain named Product Broker Agreement, whose FunctionalPattern is Agree Terms.   The generic behaviors for ServiceDomains that conform to the Agree Terms FunctionalPattern correspond to the following Actions: Evaluate, Initiate, Notify, Retrieve, and Update.
initiateBrokerAgreement is therefore one of the generic ServiceOperations for this ServiceDomain; this operation is structured according to the following semantic grammar, which applies to all generic ServiceOperations:
&lt;action&gt;&lt;control record&gt;
where &lt;action&gt; = initiate and &lt;control record&gt; = BrokerAgreement.
BehaviorQualifiers named "Legal Terms" and "Regulatory Terms" are used to define more specific operations named initiateBrokerAgreementLegalTerms and initiateBrokerAgreementRegulatoryTerms, according to the following semantic grammar:
&lt;action&gt;&lt;control record&gt;&lt;behavior qualifier&gt;

For the Product Broker ServiceDomain, BehaviorQualifiers named "Legal Terms" and "Regulatory Terms" are applied to define more specific operations named initiateBrokerAgreementLegalTerms and initiateBrokerAgreementRegulatoryTerms.</documentation>

Comments:
It is of importance that all involved parties agree on the whole. 
In a legal context the arrangements within an agreement will always be expressed in terms and conditions.
An agreement can be formal or informal, written or spoken , represented on paper or digital etc..  

A contract is a promise or set of promises that are legally enforceable and, if violated, allow the injured party access to legal remedies.[1] Contract law recognises and governs the rights and duties arising from agreements.[2] In the Anglo-American common law, formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party must have capacity to enter the contract.[3] Although most oral contracts are binding, some types of contracts may require formalities such as being in the form of a signed, dated written agreement in order for a party to be bound to its terms

BIAN has identified a standard set of Actions that characterize the different types of ServiceOperations.  Each ServiceOperation executes exactly one Action.  There are currently 15 standard actions terms.
Examples
Currently the full list of Actions is as follows: Register, Initiate, Activate, Create, Configure, Update, Feedback, Execute, Evaluate, Provide, Grant, Request, Control, Notify, Retrieve.


A Capability is the capacity of a ServiceDomain to fulfill a Responsibility that it owns without relying on other Service Domains.

Comments
The business role or purpose of a ServiceDomain is characterized by its FunctionalPattern.  BIAN has identified 18 generic FunctionalPatterns  that can be applied to assets.  For example, the asset of a computer can be operated, an employee can be assigned, a relationship can be managed.  
A ServiceDomain is responsible for implementing its particular FunctionalPattern on each instance of its associated AssetType for the full life cycle.  So, for example, the ServiceDomain that 'manages' customer relationships is responsible for doing so for every customer relationship from the first time the customer is identified to the last time the customer has involvement with the bank.
Examples
Design, Direct, Manage, Register -- these are some of the FunctionalPatterns currently defined.</documentation>

				<documentation xml:lang="en">Every Bank has a Banking Strategy to realize the Banks Strategic Goals. 
BIAN's Business Capability Model is a general accepted reference model of business capabilities that are needed to make a bank a bank. The Organization specific Banking Business Capability model will support the Banking Strategy.
A Banking Strategy is, amongst others, supported by an Information System Strategy. Often the principles of no-redundancy of data and functionality is expressed.
The Information System Strategy type that BIAN proposes is to decompose the Bank into a number of Mutual Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) Service Domains. 
These Service Domains are banking capabilities from the structuring perspective of the Information System Strategy. This terminology creates confusion. So BIAN will use the word "Capability" to refer to the "Business Capability" and use the word "Capacity" when talking about a "Service Domain".
When defining a Service Domain, subject matter experts deliver a number of Business Scenario's . A business Scenario is an interaction between multiple service operations that together realize the objective of the scenario. A business scenario is actually realizing a business service. The interaction between the service operations is expressed by sending and receiving messages to and from service operations. These messages contain data about business objects and bring this data in a specific context so that the message get meaning for the service operation. All the Service Operation interactions expressed by the incoming and outgoing messages represent the life-cycle information about an instance of an Asset Type. The type of information to capture the life-cycle data of an instance of an asset is called a "Control Record". A Control record captures all the life-cycle data of an Asset Type. An Asset Type is a classification of a composition of one or more business objects, together having value for the business. 
Each component of the Asset Type has information that can be expressed in a so called "Behavior Qualifier", which is in itself an expression information about business objects in context.  All information expressing information about objects in context belong to the Business Information Layer. The business objects independent from functional context are defined in the Business Object layer. 

The Business Object Layer will be the foundation for an Enterprise Wide Information Model. 
The Business Information Layer will carry information that is derived from Business Object characteristics and their relationships. The Control Record, Analytical Objects, Behavior Qualifiers, Asset-Types, Messages, Business Documents, Reports, Balanced Score Cards, Dash Boards, etc. belong to this layer. Information is the life blood of the running enterprise. So information will support the dynamics of the Bank , which is expressed at the behavior layer. To this layer belong the conepts of Business Scenario's, Banking Business Capabilities and Service Domains.</documentation>
