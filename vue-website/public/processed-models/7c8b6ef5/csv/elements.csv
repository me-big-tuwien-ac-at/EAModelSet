Business processes or business functions are assigned to a single business role with certain responsibilities or skills. A business actor that is assigned to a business role ultimately performs the corresponding behavior. A business role may be assigned to one or more business processes or business functions, while a business actor may be assigned to a business role. 

A business interface or an application interface may be used by a business role, while a business interface may be part of a business role (through a composition relationship, which is not shown explicitly in the interface notation). The name of a business role should preferably be a noun.",""
