Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
The common agricultural policy (CAP) – one of Europe’s oldest policies – has evolved along with the EU. Today's CAP supports a modern, market-oriented farming sector ensuring the provision of safe, affordable, high quality food, produced sustainably and respecting strict standards (environmental, animal welfare, food safety, etc.), as well as supporting investment in the broader rural economy.&#xD;

Article 168 TFEU, ex Article 152 TEC&#xD;
1.	A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Union action, which shall complement national policies, shall be directed towards improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health. Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges, by promoting research into their causes, their transmission and their prevention, as well as health information and education, and monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health. The Union shall complement the Member States' action in reducing drugs-related health damage, including information and prevention.&#xD;
2.	The Union shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the areas referred to in this Article and, if necessary, lend support to their action. It shall in particular encourage cooperation between the Member States to improve the complementarity of their health services in cross-border areas. Member States shall, in liaison with the Commission, coordinate among themselves their policies and programmes in the areas referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission may, in close contact with the Member States, take any useful initiative to promote such coordination, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The European Parliament shall be kept fully informed.&#xD;
3.	The Union and the Member States shall foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the sphere of public health.&#xD;
4.	By way of derogation from Article 2(5) and Article 6(a) and in accordance with Article 4(2)(k) the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives referred to in this Article through adopting in order to meet common safety concerns: (a) measures setting high standards of quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin, blood and blood derivatives; these measures shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures; (b) measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields which have as their direct objective the protection of public health; (c) measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and devices for medical use.&#xD;
5.	The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, may also adopt incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health and in particular to combat the major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health, and measures which have as their direct objective the protection of public health regarding tobacco and the abuse of alcohol, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States.&#xD;
6.	The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may also adopt recommendations for the purposes set out in this Article.&#xD;
7.	Union action shall respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the definition of their health policy and for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. The responsibilities of the Member States shall include the management of health services and medical care and the allocation of the resources assigned to them. The measures referred to in paragraph 4(a) shall not affect national provisions on the donation or medical use of organs and blood.&#xD;

The directive sets out rules on the use of public contracts for the provision of works, supplies or services by companies or individuals and the exemptions which can be applied. The legislation specifies that when national authorities use public procurement to invite tenders to provide works, supplies or services, they must treat all applicants equally and not discriminate between them. They must also be transparent in their dealings. This Directive is considered as a Legal Interoperability Specification, as it shall be transposed in a National or Regional Binding Instrument when designing the solution using the e-procurement Solution Architecture Template.&#xD;

Interoperable Digital Public Services Implementation Orientation ABB is a Business Object setting decision making rules/criteria/principles followed at implementing a digital public services through organisations, persons, objects or events &#xD;
&#xD;
The following implementation orientations are identified in the literature: integration, technology, governance and legal.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The INTEGRATION ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on data resources and on information management capabilities to manage information resources over their life cycle (i.e. scanning, collecting, organising, processing, maintaining, etc.) to understand societal needs, to embed data throughout the policy cycle, and to develop a culture of data analytics (OECD, 2018). The integration orientation will be based on semantic interoperability aiming for the design of a shared knowledge base of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by using and/or sharing of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge (i.e. data set catalogue, base registries, catalogue of ontologies); &#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability by exchanging capabilities of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge with the environment (i.e. representation, data mappings); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability by semantic interoperability agreements (i.e. ontologies).  &#xD;
&#xD;
•	The TECHNOLOGY ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on ICT resources like solutions and infrastructure and on ICT management capabilities to manage the provision of services (i.e. business operations, decision making, internal support, etc.) to users and the consumption of services by ministries and agencies (OECD, 2018). The technology orientation will be based on technical interoperability aiming for the design of a shared platform of ICT resources (i.e. the platform) that enables:&#xD;
i) structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of software components (i.e. service registry service, networks, reusable building blocks, common [back office] services);&#xD;
ii) behavioural interoperability with ICT exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. intermediation services, interfaces); an&#xD;
iii) governance interoperability with technical interoperability agreements (i.e. protocols, choreography rules).&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The GOVERNANCE ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on the governance resources (Grant et al., 2007) and on governance management capabilities/archetypes to manage the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) for the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) to achieve a more agile, effective, and digitally inclusive public engagement, to increase trust in government, and to enhance government transparency (OECD, 2018; Weill &amp; Woodham, 2002). The governance orientation will be based on organisational interoperability aiming for the design of a shared governance framework of [re]usable organisational resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogue);&#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability with organisational exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. service delivery model); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability with organisational interoperability agreements (i.e. service level agreements, governance structures).&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The LEGAL ORIENTATION (Santosuossa and Malerba, 2014) is characterized by a focus on legal and regulatory frameworks based in displayed leadership and political commitment to ensure adaptation to rapidly changing technological and diverse social environments with high-level requirements to achieve coherence and effective support to digital public services implementation (OECD, 2018). The legal orientation will be based in legal interoperability aiming for the design of a shared legal framework of [re]usable legal resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by legislation on reusing and/or sharing orientation and guidelines (i.e. legislation catalogue, interoperability reference architectures);&#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability by legislation on exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. interoperability frameworks); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability by legislation on governance agreements (i.e. GDPR).&#xD;

        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Non-binding Instrument ABB is a Business Object, involving no obligation, which are available to the European institutions to carry out their tasks. The European non-binding, declaratory instruments listed in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are recommendations and opinions:
•	Recommendations are non-mandatory acts issued by the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, or the European Central Bank which suggest a certain form of conduct to those to whom they are addressed without imposing any legal obligations.
•	Opinions are non-binding legal acts adopted by the European institutions which do not bind those to whom they are addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Public administrations communications are not non-binding instruments. For example, in the EC, a Communication (i.e. on the European Interoperability Framework) is part of a standard procedure followed facing a new policy challenge. It is a policy paper, addressed to EU lawmakers, to inform them of the situation, and usually including proposals for solving the problem. The Communication is usually preceded by a public consultation, in which the EC invites all interested parties (including citizens, businesses, associations, local authorities etc.) to provide their point of view on the topic.

Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also provides for non binding legal instruments.&#xD;
- Recommendations call upon the party to whom they are addressed to behave in a particular way without placing them under any legal obligation&#xD;
- Opinions issued by the EU institutions give assessments of situations or developments in the Union or in the individual Member States. They may also also prepare the way for subsequent, legally binding acts, or be a prerequisite for the institution of proceedings before the Court of Justice&#xD;
Recommendations and Opinions have moral and political significance, without being legally binding&#xD;
The three other main forms of actions that shape the EU legal order without having legally binding effect are Resolutions, Declarations and Action programmes.&#xD;

Action Plan for the future of Organic Production in the European Union
The Commission launched a consultation for the review of the European policy on organic agriculture in 2012-2013. This consultation has also been an opportunity to consult experts, stakeholders and the public on areas where a new action plan might be needed. To help organic farmers, producers and retailers adjust to the proposed policy changes and meet future challenges, the Commission has also approved an Action Plan on the future of Organic Production in Europe. The Plan foresees to better inform farmers on rural development and EU farm policy initiatives encouraging organic farming, to strengthen links between EU research and innovation projects and organic production and to encourage the use of organic food, e.g. in schools.&#xD;

        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Legal Act ABB is a Business Object formalising a set of rules on a subject potentially including requirements concerning digital public services. The granularity of the requirements might be of high level or detail level. Requirements of high-level granularity contain generic/abstract functional requirements like principles and/or recommendations with considerable degrees for transposition/execution and of not binding nature. On the other side, requirements of detail-level granularity imply a limited degree for transposition/execution and they contain specific/concrete functionalities, solution components, data, procedures, and/or technical specifications or standards to be used. EU legal acts are legislative or non-legislative acts adopted by the European institutions (Article 288 TFEU). With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009. The names &quot;European Union&quot; or &quot;EU&quot; have replaced &quot;European Community&quot;, &quot;Community&quot; or &quot;EC&quot;.

Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data&#xD;
The Regulation, applicable as of 28 May 2019, aims at removing obstacles to the free movement of non-personal data across Member States and IT systems in Europe.&#xD;
The Regulation ensures:&#xD;
- Free movement of non-personal data across borders: every organisation should be able to store and process data anywhere in the European Union,&#xD;
- The availability of data for regulatory control: public authorities will retain access to data, also when it is located in another Member State or when it is stored or processed in the cloud,&#xD;
- Easier switching of cloud service providers for professional users. The Commission has started facilitating self-regulation in this area, encouraging providers to develop codes of conduct regarding the conditions under which users can port data between cloud service providers and back into their own IT environments,&#xD;
- Full consistency and synergies with the cybersecurity package, and clarification that any security requirements that already apply to businesses storing and processing data will continue to do so when they store or process data across borders in the EU or in the cloud.&#xD;

Shared Legal Framework ABB is a Business Object setting legal (re)usable resources with convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from a legal perspective cross-legal jurisdictions. This convergence power is based in the legally binding nature of these resources enabling seamless exchange of data, information, and knowledge. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared legal framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the legal perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared legal framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the legal perspective). The level of legal interoperability will constrain digital public services cross-legal jurisdictions. The shared legal framework enables:&#xD;
i) structural interoperability with legal resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. legal entities base registries enabling authoritative sources of data, information, and knowledge);&#xD;
ii) behavioural interoperability with legal resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. authentication and data exchange services); and&#xD;
iii) governance interoperability with legal resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge (i.e. Legal Interoperability Agreements like the Berlin declaration).&#xD;

EUCARIS - registry network&#xD;
EUCARIS is an initiative of several European countries and can be described as a cooperation between several national registration authorities. Formalised in a multilateral treaty, this cooperation is focused on the data-exchange regarding vehicle registration, driving licences, and the accompanying personal data. For this exchange, a system is used which was especially developed for this purpose: EUCARIS II. It is essential to note that EUCARIS makes no use of a central European database. Each country is responsible for its own registry of vehicle and driving licence information and its own registration procedures. Through their national registration authority other government institutions can request information on e.g. vehicles from another country. The national registration authority becomes a central hub in EUCARIS.&#xD;

Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2017/46 of 10 January 2017 on the security of communication and information systems in the European Commission. The Commission's approach should take into account EU policy initiatives and legislation on network and information security, industry standards and good practices, to comply with all relevant legislation and to allow interoperability and compatibility.  This decision applies to all communication and information systems (CISs) which are owned, procured, managed or operated by or on behalf of the Commission and all usage of those CISs by the Commission.
This decision sets out the basic principles, objectives, organisation and responsibilities regarding the security of those CISs, and in particular for Commission departments owning, procuring, managing or operating CISs and including CISs provided by an internal IT service provider.

Ecolabel - Member State Competent Body &#xD;
The Competent Body is the independent organisation responsible for assessing, awarding, and managing EU Ecolabel applications and licences on the national level. The Competent Body provides guidance on the documents needed for the dossier, such as declarations, data sheets, and test results. Recommendations on product testing laboratories that are ISO 17025 accredited or equivalent are shared, along with any relevant technical expertise needed to complete the application.&#xD;
Upon application approval, the Competent Body issues the contract and licence upon approving the application. This contract sets out the services or range of products covered within the licence, including any trade names or manufacturer’s internal reference numbers. It will also lay out the terms of use of the EU Ecolabel, following the standard contract in Annex IV of the Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of 25 November 2009. Once the contract has been signed, a certificate can be asked for/will be sent, depending on the Competent Body. This certificate will detail: the licence number that can be used with the EU Ecolabel logo; the legal name of the applicant; the services or range of products awarded the EU Ecolabel; all relevant trade names under which the product is sold or the service is marketed. The Competent Body will give the final validation on when the EU Ecolabel logo and the licence number can be used on the EU Ecolabel services and products that have met the criteria.&#xD;

The new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) is part of the Communication (COM(2017)134) from the European Commission adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services.&#xD;
It offers public administrations 47 concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. &#xD;
The new EIF is undertaken in the context of the Commission priority to create a Digital Single Market in Europe. The public sector, which accounts for over a quarter of total employment and represents approximately a fifth of the EU’s GDP through public procurement, plays a key role in the Digital Single Market as a regulator, services provider and employer.&#xD;
The successful implementation of the EIF will improve the quality of European public services and will create an environment where public administrations can collaborate digitally.&#xD;

The EU cybersecurity certification framework&#xD;
The European Commission puts forward the creation of a EU certification framework for ICT security products in its 2017 proposal for a regulation.&#xD;
On 13 September 2017 the Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the &quot;&quot;EU Cybersecurity Agency&quot;&quot;, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification (''Cybersecurity Act'').&#xD;
Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the digital single market. At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificates, there is an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market.&#xD;
The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards.&#xD;
The certification will attest that ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service.&#xD;
The schemes proposed in the future European framework will rely as much as possible on international standards as a way to avoid creating trade barriers and ensuring coherence with international initiatives.&quot;&#xD;

        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Shared Governance Framework ABB is a Business Object setting organizational (re)usable resources with convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from an organizational perspective. This convergence power is based on the enabling communication and harmonization nature of these resources influencing collaboration cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared governance framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the organisational perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared governance framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the organizational perspective). The level of organizational interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared governance framework enables:&#xD;
i) structural interoperability with organisational resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogues);&#xD;
ii) behavioural interoperability with organisational resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. user experience patterns and service delivery mode); and&#xD;
iii) governance interoperability with governance resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge (i.e. Organisational Interoperability Agreements).&#xD;

Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8.&#xD;
UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.&#xD;
UTF-8 has a one-octet encoding unit.  It uses all bits of an octet, but has the quality of preserving the full US-ASCII [US-ASCII] range: US-ASCII characters are encoded in one octet having the normal US-ASCII value, and any octet with such a value can only stand for a US-ASCII character, and nothing else.&#xD;
UTF-8 encodes UCS characters as a varying number of octets, where the number of octets, and the value of each, depend on the integer value assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646 (the character number, a.k.a. code position, code point or Unicode scalar value).&#xD;

UUID&#xD;
A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs. Since a UUID is a fixed size and contains a time field, it is possible for values to rollover.  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. The internal representation of a UUID is a specific sequence of bits in memory, as described in Section 4.  To accurately represent a UUID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the bit sequence to a string representation. Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant digit first.  The hexadecimal values &quot;a&quot; through &quot;f&quot; are output as lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.&#xD;

Open Contracting Data Standard schema-level mapping - Template and guidance&#xD;
This guide details an example of using the OCDS 1.1 Field Level Mapping Template to map the fields from a single table in a fictional e-GP system to OCDS. &#xD;
&#xD;
Step 1: Source System Details&#xD;
OCDS data may originate in multiple source systems, therefore it is important to record the details of the source system we are mapping from. &#xD;
Step 2: Source Field Details&#xD;
Using the (Source) Fields sheet, populate the following information for each field in the source table: the system the field is from (as recorded in step 1); the table in which the field is located; the field title.&#xD;
Where additional context is required you may also record a narrative description of the source field in the description field and it might also be useful to add an example of the value that the field takes alongside further technical information on the type and multiplicity of the field.&#xD;
Step 3: Mapping&#xD;
The mapping template has a sheet for each stage of the contracting process, from (OCDS) 2. Planning through to (OCDS) 6. Implementation, with details of the relevant fields from the OCDS schema, in addition to the (OCDS) 1. General (all stages) sheet which contains fields relevant to all stages of the contracting process. Review each of the (OCDS) sheets in the mapping template to identify fields in the OCDS schema to which a field in the source system can be mapped. &#xD;
Step 4: Review&#xD;
Repeat steps 1-3 for all tables and all source systems to complete the mapping.&#xD;
Gaps in currently held data: if you identify data OCDS requests, but that you do not hold, engage with data users to consider whether this additional data could and should be provided.&#xD;
Gaps in OCDS: you might have data which is not covered by OCDS. In these cases, talk with the OCDS helpdesk to see whether this should be included in an extension to the standard. Additional fields can be documented at the bottom of each mapping sheet in the template.&#xD;

Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles : date and language&#xD;
date: Because we want to perform automated operations like sorting on the date, we can select the Dublin Core property dcterms:date. This property can take a string value. We can indicate that the value string is formatted in accordance with the W3C Date and Time Formats specification by using syntax encoding scheme dcterms:W3CDTF.&#xD;
language: The language needs to be selected from a controlled list. We achieve this by requiring the use of three-letter codes listed in the international standard ISO 639-3 for the representation of names of languages (such as &quot;&quot;eng&quot;&quot; for &quot;&quot;English&quot;&quot;) together with the syntax encoding scheme dcterms:ISO639-3 as a datatype. For this, we can use the DCMI property dcterms:language, which can accommodate either an identifier for the language term or a string.&#xD;

N.B. Context: All documents concerning an anti-trust case are stored by case number in the case management application called &quot;CMAfx&quot;. Documents are stored in different formats: pdf format (if available in paper form only and subsequently digitised) or word, excel, tif, rtf, html, txt version (if received as such or produced by DG Competition). CMAfx contains also procedural steps and case information, such as the composition of the case team, relevant legal basis, type of case, priority, name of undertaking concerned etc. Access to CMAfx is restricted to DG Competition personnel and national experts on secondment using DG Competition IT infrastructure. The undertakings answering the queries are obliged to indicate the confidentiality status of their responses, i.e., whether their answer must be treated as confidential, and in that case the system does not allow submission of their responses until a non-confidential answer has been provided for each confidential one. The non-confidential versions of the Commission's decisions adopted pursuant to articles 7-10, 23 and 24 of Regulation 1/2003 are published on DG Competition website, after the confidentiality claims (with regard to business secrets and other confidential information) were cleared with the respective parties. &#xD;

The Base Registry Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because base registries include &quot;authorative sources of information&quot;, that need to be properly governed and made available. EIF's includes base registries in the conceptual model for integrated public services, and describes it as &quot;the cornerstone of European public service delivery&quot;. EIF gives several recommendations on how to manage and interact with base registries (recommendation 37, 38, 39 and 40).

GOOD PRACTICES ON BUILDING SUCESSFUL INTERCONNECTIONS OF BASE REGISTRIES&#xD;
In order to provide quick and user-friendly public services to citizens and businesses, public administrations are trying to adopt customer-centric approaches and readjust their ways of working.&#xD;
One way to achieve efficiency and increase user-friendliness is through the ‘once-only principle’. Instead of asking the citizen for information that they have already provided, public administrations will reuse the information they already have. Much of this information is stored in authoritative databases called base registries. As the authentic sources of data for public administrations, base registries are one of the basic building blocks of public services and are the key to making the once-only principle a reality.&#xD;
The document contains some good practices to foster access to the data contained in these base registries.&#xD;
The good practices presented, are grouped according to the layered interoperability model proposed by the European Interoperability&#xD;
Framework (EIF).&#xD;

ISA2 Core Vocabularies&#xD;
&#xD;
Core Vocabularies are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. &#xD;
Public administrations can use and extend the Core Vocabularies in the following contexts:&#xD;
•	Development of new systems: the Core Vocabularies can be used as a default starting point for designing the conceptual and logical data models in newly developed information systems.&#xD;
•	Information exchange between systems: the Core Vocabularies can become the basis of a context-specific data model used to exchange data among existing information systems.&#xD;
•	Data integration: the Core Vocabularies can be used to integrate data that comes from disparate data sources and create a data mash-up.&#xD;
•	Open data publishing: the Core Vocabularies can be used as the foundation of a common export format for data in base registries like cadastres, business registers and service portals. &#xD;
•	ISA² has developed the Core Vocabularies for public administrations in an open process with the active involvement of specific working groups. The Core Vocabularies developed are the following:&#xD;
-	Core Person: captures the fundamental characteristics of a person, e.g. name, gender, date of birth, location.&#xD;
-	Registered organisation: captures the fundamental characteristics of a legal entity (e.g. its identifier, activities) which is created through a formal registration process, typically in a national or regional register.&#xD;
-	Core Location: captures the fundamental characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name or geometry.&#xD;
-	Core Public service: captures the fundamental characteristics of a service offered by a public administration.&#xD;
-	Core Criterion and Core Evidence: describe the principles and the means that a private entity must fulfil to become eligible or qualified to perform public services. A Criterion is a rule or a principle that is used to judge, evaluate or test something. An Evidence is a means to prove a Criterion.&#xD;
-	Core Public organisation: describes public organisations in the European Union.&#xD;

EURES - Job vacancy&#xD;
Most of the jobs on the EURES Job Mobility Portal come from the job vacancies databases managed by the Public Employment Services of the countries participating in EURES. Using a technology called Web Services, the EURES search engine instantly, in real time, interrogates each national database for jobs. These jobs can be of two types:&#xD;
“EURES jobs&quot;, displayed with a blue flag, which are jobs where an employer has expressed an interest in recruiting from another country, or any other jobs advertised in the national jobs databases.&#xD;
There is, in addition, a central database where EURES advisers can manually post jobs that will all be flagged as &quot;EURES jobs&quot;. This is for the time being the only way for those few countries that are not yet fully connected to Web Services to advertise jobs on the EURES portal. This solution can, however, also be used for other specific purposes, such as when an employer wishes to publish a vacancy in several languages etc., which may not always be possible in a national database.&#xD;

ESPD - Exchange data model &#xD;
The ESPD exchange data model (ESPD-EDM) is used for the ESPD service provided by the European Commission.&#xD;
The ESPD Exchange Data Model was designed to implement the data requirements expressed in the Annex 2 of the COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/7 of 5 January 2016 (from now on &quot;the Annex to the Regulation 2016/7&quot;), establishing the standard form for the European Single Document. Additionally to these requirements, the model took also into account the Information Requirements Model specified by the CEN/BII-Workshops.[3] (namely Workshop 3), and the latest developments relating to the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) in e-Sens.[4].&#xD;
One premise that has ruled the design and implementation life-cycle of the ESPD-EDM has been ''not to reinvent the wheel''. Thus some very early key decisions were: &#xD;
&#xD;
(i)	select a mature business language for the naming, design and implementation of the ESPD-EDM; &#xD;
(ii)	reuse as much as possible existing information components and libraries ''as-they-are''; &#xD;
(iii)	for those entities that are not defined in any standard specification, design new components in such a way that they can be reused in other situations and domains, both in e-Procurement and beyond e-Procurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
OASIS UBL-2.1 standard was chosen as the best candidate to base the ESPD-EDM upon. The main reasons for this decisions were: &#xD;
i.	The European Commission is already using (and recommending) UBL-2.1 for e-Documents.[5] ; &#xD;
ii.	Most of the concepts and components necessary for the ESPD documents were already defined by UBL specifically for e-Procurement; (3) Methodology and tools are available for the development of new documents, the extension of the existing UBL libraries, the semantic validation of XML instances, etc.&#xD;

The Descriptive Metadata Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because metadata facilitates opening and sharing data by providing the appropriate format, description of the content, high level of quality in order to achieve interoperability as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 42: &quot;[..] Ensure that open data is accompanied by high quality, machine-readable metadata in non-proprietary formats, including a description of their content, the way data is collected and its level of quality and the licence terms under which it is made available. The use of common vocabularies for expressing metadata is recommended.&quot;

Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description&#xD;
The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary of fifteen properties for use in resource description. The name &quot;Dublin&quot; is due to its origin at a 1995 invitational workshop in Dublin, Ohio; &quot;core&quot; because its elements are broad and generic, usable for describing a wide range of resources.&#xD;
The fifteen element &quot;Dublin Core&quot; described in this standard is part of a larger set of metadata vocabularies and technical specifications maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). The full set of vocabularies, DCMI Metadata Terms [DCMI-TERMS], also includes sets of resource classes (including the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE]), vocabulary encoding schemes, and syntax encoding schemes. The terms in DCMI vocabularies are intended to be used in combination with terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles and on the basis of the DCMI Abstract Model [DCAM].&#xD;

Reference data consists typically of a small, discrete set of values that are not updated as part of business transactions but are usually used to impose consistent classiﬁcation. Reference data normally has a low update frequency. Reference data is relevant across more than one business systems belonging to different organisations and sectors

The Reference Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because Reference Data can be shared and reused (e.g. in the form of taxonomies or controlled vocabularies) between organisation to agree on some  basic information. Management of reference data is a priority as suggested by EIF's recommendation 31: &quot;Put in place an information management strategy at the highest possible level to avoid fragmentation and duplication. Management of metadata, master data and reference data should be prioritised.&quot;

The eDelivery AS4 Profile is a modular profile of the ebMS3 and AS4 OASIS specifications. Its core is a mandatory Common Profile that selects, extends and profiles the AS4 ebHandler Conformance Profile and AS4 Additional Features and provides a common Usage Profile. This Common Profile can be implemented using open source or closed source AS4 software implementations. It is aligned with, and corresponds to a subset of, the AS4 profile for TSOs (Transmission System Operators) developed by ENTSOG (the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas).&#xD;
In addition to the Common Profile, this specification provides a number of optional Profile Enhancement modules that specify functionality enhancements covering AS4 message exchange in four corner topologies, the use of AS4 in conjunction with the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) specification, and Dynamic Receiver and Dynamic Sender behavior.&#xD;

Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data&#xD;
The Regulation, applicable as of 28 May 2019, aims at removing obstacles to the free movement of non-personal data across Member States and IT systems in Europe.&#xD;
The Regulation ensures:&#xD;
- Free movement of non-personal data across borders: every organisation should be able to store and process data anywhere in the European Union,&#xD;
- The availability of data for regulatory control: public authorities will retain access to data, also when it is located in another Member State or when it is stored or processed in the cloud,&#xD;
- Easier switching of cloud service providers for professional users. The Commission has started facilitating self-regulation in this area, encouraging providers to develop codes of conduct regarding the conditions under which users can port data between cloud service providers and back into their own IT environments,&#xD;
- Full consistency and synergies with the cybersecurity package, and clarification that any security requirements that already apply to businesses storing and processing data will continue to do so when they store or process data across borders in the EU or in the cloud.&#xD;

      <documentation>DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
A shared legal framework is the set of legal (re)usable resources with  convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from a legal perspective cross-legal jurisdictions. This convergence power is based in the legally binding nature of these resources enabling seamless exchange of data, information, and knowledge. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared legal framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the legal perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared legal framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the legal perspective). The level of legal interoperability will constrain digital public services cross-legal jurisdictions. The shared legal framework enables:&#xD;
i)          structural interoperability with legal resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. legal entities base registries enabling authoritative sources of data, information, and knowledge);&#xD;
ii)         behavioural interoperability with legal resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. authentication and data exchange services); and&#xD;
iii)        governance interoperability with legal resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge (i.e. Legal Interoperability Agreements like the Berlin declaration).”&#xD;

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;
The Base Registry ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it includes &quot;authorative sources of information&quot;, that need to be made available. EIF's includes base registries in the conceptual model for integrated public services, and describes it as &quot;the cornerstone of European public service delivery&quot;.

EXAMPLES:&#xD;
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): &#xD;
&#xD;
Belgian national register&#xD;
&#xD;
The National Register refers to the information processing system which records, stores and communicates information relating to the identification of natural persons ie citizens.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is therefore a central database in which are recorded:&#xD;
•	all Belgians residing in Belgium;&#xD;
•	all Belgians residing abroad who register in the population registers held in Belgian diplomatic missions or consular posts abroad;&#xD;
•	all foreigners residing in Belgium who are admitted or authorized to settle or reside in the Kingdom;&#xD;
•	all foreigners (and their family members) who declare themselves refugees or who are seeking recognition of refugee status.&#xD;
&#xD;
The municipalities (and the Immigration Office for the last category of the population) are responsible for recording the information. As a pillar of e-government, the National Register ensures the sharing of authentic data identifying individuals between different public services with limited access to such data. The Sectorial Committee of the National Register established within the Commission for the Protection of Privacy is competent to authorize access to the information of the National Register or the communication thereof.&#xD;

&#xD;
EUROSTAT - Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) &#xD;
Principle 1: Population thresholds&#xD;
The NUTS regulation defines minimum and maximum population thresholds for the size of the NUTS regions:&#xD;
&#xD;
Level        Minimum        Maximum&#xD;
NUTS 1        3 000 000        7 000 000&#xD;
NUTS 2        800 000        3 000 000&#xD;
NUTS 3        150 000        150 000&#xD;
&#xD;
For administrative levels of NUTS, it is sufficient if the average size of the corresponding regions lies within the thresholds; in case of non-administrative levels, each individual region should do so. Exceptions exist however in case of geographical, socio-economic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances.&#xD;
Despite the aim of ensuring that regions of comparable size all appear at the same NUTS level, each level still contains regions which differ greatly in terms of population.&#xD;
Principle 2: NUTS favours administrative divisions&#xD;
For practical reasons the NUTS classification generally mirrors the territorial administrative division of the Member States. This supports the availability of data and the implementation capacity of policy.&#xD;
Principle 3: Regular and extraordinary amendments&#xD;
The NUTS classification can be amended, but generally not more frequently than every three years. The amendments are usually based on changes of the territorial structure in one or more Member States.&#xD;
In case of a substantial reorganisation of the administrative structure of a Member State, amendments to the NUTS may be adopted at intervals of less than three years. This has only happened once so far, in 2014 for Portugal.&#xD;

Shared Knowledge Base ABB is a Data Object setting semantic (re)usable resources with convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from a semantic perspective cross public administrations, and cross borders. This convergence power is based on the enabling sense-making nature of these resources influencing the enactment of common understanding from the existing organisational information. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared knowledge base (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared knowledge base (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective). The level of semantic interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared knowledge base enables:&#xD;
i)          structural interoperability with semantic resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. data set catalogue);&#xD;
ii)         behavioural interoperability with semantic resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Metadata mappings); and&#xD;

The core of Camunda BPM is a model execution engine that supports the OMG standards BPMN 2.0 for process automation, CMMN 1.1 for case management and DMN 1.1 for decision management.&#xD;
Camunda BPM ships with a set of applications to help you model, execute and administer process applications running on the Camunda core engine. Those applications interact with the core engine's public REST API. You can also create your own applications that may also use the core engine's public Java API. It is lightweight and requires less than 3MB of disk space. It can run in any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and comes with extended integration for different runtime containers.&#xD;
The engine can be accessed via the REST API, or via the Java API and existing integrations with Spring and Java EE can be used. BPMN service tasks can be implemented in Java code, or the built-in REST and SOAP connectors can be used. Scripts, expressions and templates can also be applied for process implementation. Clustering for horizontal scalability is straightforward as the engine is stateless: multiple instances can share the same database.&#xD;
BPMN 2.0 Processes permits the fully automated service orchestration and human workflow management. &#xD;

eDelivery&#xD;
Supporting secure and reliable exchange of data and documents&#xD;
eDelivery is a network of nodes for digital communications. It is based on a distributed model where every participant becomes a node using standard transport protocols and security policies. eDelivery helps public administrations to exchange electronic data and documents with other public administrations, businesses and citizens, in an interoperable, secure, reliable and trusted way. eDelivery is one of the building blocks of the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU. The CEF eDelivery building block is based on the AS4 messaging protocol, open and free for all, developed by the OASIS standards development organisation. To ease its adoption in Europe, eDelivery uses the AS4 implementation guidelines defined by the Member States in the e-SENS Large Scale Pilot. Organisations must install an Access Point, or use a Service Provider, to exchange information with the AS4 messaging protocol.&#xD;

eDelivery&#xD;
Supporting secure and reliable exchange of data and documents&#xD;
eDelivery is a network of nodes for digital communications. It is based on a distributed model where every participant becomes a node using standard transport protocols and security policies. eDelivery helps public administrations to exchange electronic data and documents with other public administrations, businesses and citizens, in an interoperable, secure, reliable and trusted way. eDelivery is one of the building blocks of the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU. The CEF eDelivery building block is based on the AS4 messaging protocol, open and free for all, developed by the OASIS standards development organisation. To ease its adoption in Europe, eDelivery uses the AS4 implementation guidelines defined by the Member States in the e-SENS Large Scale Pilot. Organisations must install an Access Point, or use a Service Provider, to exchange information with the AS4 messaging protocol.&#xD;

Graylog2 - open source log management platform&#xD;
Graylog2 is an open source log management platform. Each message is saved in an Elasticsearch database and a web interface allows to manage and analyse the logs.&#xD;
Graylog2 is divided into two parts: graylog2-server and graylog2-web-interface. The first is a Java application that accepts messages on different protocols: UDP, TCP, GELF, AMQP... Each message is analysed and saved in the Elasticsearch database. A Rest API is also integrated into the tool and is used in particular by the web-interface part. This allows to manage users, streams and dashboards. &#xD;
Some possible uses: &#xD;
•	Centralization of the logs: several types of inputs: syslog, GELF, raw... Rather than having to connect to each of the servers to consult the error logs, they can be configured to send all the messages in Graylog2.&#xD;
•	Debug application&#xD;
•	Exception handling&#xD;
•	Log analysis&#xD;
For example, it can easily list the clients who are still using the deprecated version of an API. Another search can e.g. allow you to list the largest consumers or the most used parts of an API.&#xD;
Graylog Enterprise is built on top of the Graylog open source platform and offers additional features: &#xD;
•	Archiving: automatically archive the data that are not searched through very often. Store this data on more cost-effective, slower hard disks and make it available for search in Graylog only when needed.&#xD;
•	Audit Log: Graylog Enterprise also offers Audit Log capabilities. Audit Log records and stores actions taken by a user or administrator that make changes in the Graylog system.&#xD;

Log4j 2&#xD;
Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility, part of the Apache Logging Services project of the Apache Software Foundation. &#xD;
Log4j 1.x has been widely adopted and used in many applications. However, through the years development on it has slowed down. It has become more difficult to maintain due to its need to be compliant with very old versions of Java and became End of Life in August 2015. &#xD;
Improvements in Log4j 2:&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 is designed to be usable as an audit logging framework. &#xD;
•	Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency than Log4j 1.x and Logback.&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 is garbage free for stand-alone applications, and low garbage for web applications during steady state logging. This reduces pressure on the garbage collector and can give better response time performance.&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 uses a Plugin system that makes it extremely easy to extend the framework by adding new Appenders, Filters, Layouts, Lookups, and Pattern Converters without requiring any changes to Log4j.&#xD;
•	Support for custom log levels. Custom log levels can be defined in code or in configuration.&#xD;
•	Support for Message objects. Messages allow support for interesting and complex constructs to be passed through the logging system and be efficiently manipulated. &#xD;
•	Log4j 2 takes advantage of Java 5 concurrency support and performs locking at the lowest level possible. &#xD;
•	It is an Apache Software Foundation project following the community and support model used by all ASF projects. &#xD;

ePHOENIX&#xD;
epoline® PHOENIX (ePHOENIX) is a document and dossier management system designed to support the processes involved in the handling of Intellectual Property (IP)-related documents.&#xD;
The system, which was developed by the European Patent Office, allows IP offices to manage application dossiers in electronic form. It provides a means for scanning all incoming documents and a user interface to display the resulting electronic dossier on screen, as well as supporting the printing and distribution of work.&#xD;
ePHOENIX replaces physical paper files, thus removing the need for space-consuming archives and time-consuming transportation and management. Representing a further step towards the paperless office, the system improves efficiency and cost-effectiveness throughout the life-cycle of IP documents.&#xD;
ePHOENIX is highly configurable. It provides tools and interfaces which allow existing IT systems, organisational structures, working procedures and conventions to be retained. This means minimal development costs, minimal risk and maximum user acceptance. Furthermore, it is a flexible Java-based system that can operate in a wide variety of IT architectures.&#xD;
Thanks to its customisation possibilities, ePHOENIX can also be used to handle non-IP documents.&#xD;

Apache ZooKeeper&#xD;
Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.&#xD;
ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.&#xD;
ZooKeeper aims at distilling the essence of these different services into a very simple interface to a centralized coordination service. The service itself is distributed and highly reliable. Consensus, group management, and presence protocols will be implemented by the service so that the applications do not need to implement them on their own. Application specific uses of these will consist of a mixture of specific components of Zoo Keeper and application specific conventions. ZooKeeper Recipes shows how this simple service can be used to build much more powerful abstractions.&#xD;
Apache have Java and C interfaces to Zoo Keeper for the applications themselves. A variety of client bindings is available for a number of languages including Python, Ruby and Go.&#xD;

Shared platform ABB is a Application Service setting technical (re)usable resources with convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from a technical perspective cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. This convergence power is based on the instrumental nature and efficiencies  of these resources for enabling common problem-solving approaches. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared platform (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the technical perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared platform (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the technical perspective). The level of technical interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared platform enables:&#xD;
i)          structural interoperability with technical resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. service registry service);&#xD;
ii)         behavioural interoperability with technical resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Technical interfaces); and&#xD;
iii)        governance interoperability with technical resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge(i.e. Technical Interoperability Agreements).&#xD;

e-Archiving Service ABB is an Application Service enabling the permanent or long-term storage of selected (by an authority) electronic documents or information for preservation purposes like their enduring research value and memory aid. 

The EIRA(c) differentiates between document management, record management and e-archiving as follows:
- Document management is primarily about day-to-day use of electronic documents (create/update/delete/versioning) within the operational environment;
- Record management is primarily about ensuring that information (e.g. in form of an electronic document or database record) is available for business and legal purposes (e.g. to proof and track the handling of contracts). If an electronic document or information is becoming a record (an authority declares it as a record) that electronic document or information needs to be handled by the record management service (based on specific business or legal reasons (e.g. contract negotiation)).
- e-Archiving is primarily about storing records which have been selected (by an authority) for permanent or long-term preservation due to their enduring research value and as a memory aid. An electronic document or information which a) is managed by the document management service or the record management service and b) is no longer needed for business or legal purposes or day-to-day activities, and c) still has value for research purposes or as a memory aid, the electronic document should be managed by the e-archiving service”.

The e-Archiving Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides and shares the functionality for the long-term or permanent preservation of records and information in electronic form in order to ensure their temporal egibility, reliability and integrity as stated in the EIF: &quot;Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.&quot;&#xD;

The Forms Management Component ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides  the implementation of the functionalities  of dynamic creation, distribution and analysis of forms and online surveys as stated in the EIF: &quot; Catalogues help others to find reusable resources (e.g. services, data, software, data models). Various types of catalogue exist, e.g. directories of services, libraries of software components, open data portals, registries of base registries, metadata catalogues, catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines. Commonly agreed descriptions of the services, data, registries and interoperable solutions published in catalogues are needed to enable interoperability between catalogues.&quot;&#xD;

Form Tools&#xD;
Form Tools is a forms framework written in PHP and MySQL. You download and install the script on your own website. At its heart, Form Tools is a web form creator, processor, data storage and access script. It was originally designed to work with any existing web form, but has since been expanded to create forms automatically as well.&#xD;
Form Tools is extremely versatile in how it integrates with your forms. You can use the bundled Form Builder module to create the forms automatically on your website (no programming or HTML skills necessary); you can use the PHP API to integrate your own custom form with the script; or you can simply POST your form to Form Tools, and just use it to store the form data. Anything goes! You can read about the different integration methods / form creation methods here.&#xD;
Form Tools works by creating custom database tables to store your unique form data. It provides a range of functionality customized to your data set, such as allowing you to view, update, cross-reference and export your submission data, create subsets of your data for viewing/editing by client accounts, data visualizations, and much more.&#xD;

The Data Pubblication Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides the functionalities to make public data freely available for use and reuse by others unless restriction aoply as stated in the EIF recommendation n.2: &quot;Publish the data you own as open data unless certain restrictions apply.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
EXAMPLES:&#xD;
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):&#xD;
European Data Portal &#xD;
The European Data Portal harvests the metadata of Public Sector Information available on public data portals across European countries. Information regarding the provision of data and the benefits of re-using data is also included.&#xD;
What is Open Data?&#xD;
-	Open (Government) Data refers to the information collected, produced or paid for by the public bodies (also referred to as Public Sector Information) and made freely available for re-use for any purpose. The licence will specify the terms of use. &#xD;
-	Public sector information is information held by the public sector. The Directive on the re-use of public sector information provides a common legal framework for a European market for government-held data. It is built around the key pillars of the internal market: free flow of data, transparency and fair competition. It is important to note that not all of the public sector information is Open Data.&#xD;
Within the Portal, sections are dedicated to:&#xD;
-	Searching datasets: Categories have been established to structure the metadata harvested from the various countries. These categories follow the revision of the DCAT Application Profile and have been mapped against the Eurovoc Thesaurus.&#xD;
-	Providing Data: This section gives an insight into understanding Open Data from the perspective of a data provider. In addition, instructions are offered for those who wish their data portal to be harvested by the European Data Portal.&#xD;
-	Using Data: How Open Data is being used, as well as the economic benefits of Open Data are detailed in this section.&#xD;
-	Training and Library: eLearning modules about Open Data as well as training guides and a knowledge base referencing publications around Open Data and featured projects.&#xD;
Portals can be national, regional, local or domain specific. They cover the 28 EU Member States, EEA, countries involved in the EU's neighbourhood policy and Switzerland.&#xD;

Belgian Data Portal&#xD;
The Belgian Data Portal provides data (more than 6500 datasets), tools and resources.&#xD;
Open Data is a driver for innovation, economic growth, transparency and participation. According to a European study (ref.COM (2011) 882) the cumulative economic benefits arising from the provision of public data would amount to € 40 billion per year in the EU. These data lend themselves to reuse in the context of new products and services and can improve the efficiency of public authorities. Making public sector data accessible makes it possible to involve citizens more in political and social life and to make an active contribution to policy areas such as the environment, mobility, the economy, and so on.&#xD;
The 2014-2018 Belgian government agreement states that the government will focus on opening public sector data (Open Data policy). Open public data is now the rule. Public services make available to citizens, researchers, companies and public authorities the reuse of data already available to them in the framework of their missions.&#xD;
It is more specifically data that:&#xD;
-	Public services have collected as part of their data collection missions;&#xD;
-	Do not contain (more) privacy-sensitive information that is not protected by intellectual property rights held by third parties;&#xD;
-	Are published in a format that is easy to reuse automatically (&quot;machine readable &quot;);&#xD;
-	Can be reused for commercial and non-commercial purposes.&#xD;
It is not only a matter of making public service data available, but also of building a community environment around these data. Companies can reuse some data and enrich it with their own information to market new products and services. Citizens benefit from more transparent public authorities and public services can help improve the quality of existing public data and services.&#xD;

CKAN &#xD;
CKAN is a data management system that makes data accessible by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data.&#xD;
This is a tool for making open data websites. It helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who collect a lot of data.&#xD;
Once your data is published, users can use its faceted search features to browse and find the data they need, and preview it using maps, graphs and tables – whether they are developers, journalists, researchers, NGOs, citizens, or even your own staff.&#xD;
CKAN is open source and free software, with an active community of contributors who develop and maintain its core technology. CKAN is modified and extended by an even larger community of developers who contribute to a growing library of CKAN extensions.&#xD;

Globus&#xD;
Globus is a leading provider of research data management software application and platform services.&#xD;
Globus publication capabilities are delivered through a hosted service. Published data is stored on campus, institutional, and group resources that are often managed and operated by different administrators. To associate storage resources with a data collection simply use Globus shared endpoints and associate them with the data repository to publish. Published datasets are organized by &quot;communities&quot; and their member &quot;collections&quot;. Globus users can create and manage their own communities and collections through the data publication service. A collection enables the submission of datasets with policies regarding access.&#xD;
A dataset comprises data and metadata. Policies can be set on communities or collections to manage:&#xD;
-	Metadata (schema, requirements)&#xD;
-	Access control (user and group based)&#xD;
-	Curation workflow&#xD;
-	Submission and distribution licenses&#xD;
-	Storage&#xD;
Datasets undergo curation based on a workflow defined by the community that will publish the data. Workflows may be customized by each community to capture their specific metadata and to reflect the community's review process. After the dataset is published, it is discoverable using a faceted search that allows the researcher to progressively filter results and rapidly focus in on the data of interest. The data may then be transferred to a Globus endpoint where the investigator can inspect and further process the data.&#xD;
Data publication is a premium feature available with a Globus Subscription&#xD;

freeTSA.org offers free NTP and DNSCRYPT services&#xD;
freeTSA.org provides a free Time Stamp Authority. Adding a trusted timestamp to code or to an electronic signature provides a digital seal of data integrity and a trusted date and time of when the transaction took place.&#xD;
Trusted timestamping is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification times of a document. Security here means that no one - not even the owner of the document - should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. FreeTSA trusted timestamping Software as a Service (SaaS) provides an easy method to apply RFC 3161 trusted timestamps to time-sensitive transactions through independently verified and auditable date and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) sources.&#xD;

The Content Management Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides and shares the functionalities of dynamic creation, distribution and analysis of contents (images, videos, etc.) as stated in the EIF: &quot; Catalogues help others to find reusable resources (e.g. services, data, software, data models). Various types of catalogue exist, e.g. directories of services, libraries of software components, open data portals, registries of base registries, metadata catalogues, catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines. Commonly agreed descriptions of the services, data, registries and interoperable solutions published in catalogues are needed to enable interoperability between catalogues.&quot;&#xD;

EXAMPLES:&#xD;
FPFIS-CMS: &#xD;
&quot;The European Commission announced in the Commission Internet strategy plans to transform the EUROPA web site from a source of one-way information into a tool for communication and interaction (i.e. provide modern interactive web sites for the citizens and stakeholders).&#xD;
Web sites are a key tool for external communications. They are the institution's business card. Websites are a very cost-effective and efficient means of communication. EUROPA now hosts over 460 websites. EUROPA would benefit from fewer and better sites to respond to user needs. To address the shortcomings, as part of the Commission's IT governance process, the College on 30 November 2011, instructed Commission departments to rationalise the Institution's web presence.&#xD;
Reduce the cost (human, financial, technical) of the Commission's web presence via exploiting economies of scale and eliminating redundancies by building corporate solutions. The European Commission should offer a corporate service which optimizes and harmonizes the use of different website tools, which speeds up the creation of new external dynamic and social websites (i.e. in days or weeks and not months) and which provides a common solid modern shared infrastructure to support the rapid deployment of these sites&quot;.&#xD;

- A SOAP Web service allows programmatic queries. This SOAP service is based on the technically complete, but not formally ratified as of October 2006, EPCglobal EPC Information Services (EPCIS) Version 1.0 Specification.EPCglobal EPCIS 1.0 Working Draft.&#xD;

Hibernate Validator&#xD;
Express validation rules in a standardized way using annotation-based constraints and benefit from transparent integration with a wide variety of frameworks.&#xD;
Application layer agnostic validation: Hibernate Validator allows to express and validate application constraints. The default metadata source are annotations, with the ability to override and extend through the use of XML. It is not tied to a specific application tier or programming model and is available for both server and client application programming.&#xD;
Hibernate Validator presents the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Extendable: Hibernate Validator offers a configurable bootstrap API as well as a range of built-in constraints. The latter can easily be extended by creating custom constraints.&#xD;
•	Rich metadata API: Hibernate Validator gives access to constraint configuration via a metadata API facilitating, for example, tooling integration.&#xD;
•	Reference implementation: Hibernate Validator 6.x is the reference implementation Bean Validation 2.0.&#xD;
•	Added value: Hibernate Validator offers additional value on top of the features required by Bean Validation. For example, a programmatic constraint configuration API as well as an annotation processor which plugs into the build process and raises compilation errors whenever constraint annotations are incorrectly used.&#xD;

Activiti supports open standards such as BPMN and DMN with open REST APIs for demanding human- and system-centric processes. It provides business intelligence and audit logs features for free.  And with building the solution on business processes, Activiti help to structure the software, think about user tasks, external systems and timers that need to be managed, think about transaction boundaries of the application. Building that kind of features becomes easier when structuring an application around a business process. Managing wait states, timers and asynchronous continuations becomes easier. A business process can express that structure more compact than working with the fundamental instruments that the Java platform offers like JDBC and JMS. Activiti also makes possible to link in Java or scripting for jobs.	&#xD;

Consul&#xD;
Consul has multiple components, but as a whole, it is a tool for discovering and configuring services in an infrastructure. It provides several key features:&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Service Discovery: Clients of Consul can provide a service, such as api or mysql, and other clients can use Consul to discover providers of a given service. Using either DNS or HTTP, applications can easily find the services they depend upon.&#xD;
•	Health Checking: Consul clients can provide any number of health checks, either associated with a given service (&quot;is the webserver returning 200 OK&quot;), or with the local node (&quot;is memory utilization below 90%&quot;). This information can be used by an operator to monitor cluster health, and it is used by the service discovery components to route traffic away from unhealthy hosts.&#xD;
•	KV Store: Applications can make use of Consul's hierarchical key/value store for any number of purposes, including dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election, and more. The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use.&#xD;
•	Multi Datacenter: Consul supports multiple datacenters out of the box. This means users of Consul do not have to worry about building additional layers of abstraction to grow to multiple regions.&#xD;

The Data Model ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it ensures compatible interpretations of data exchange as specified in the document &quot;Methodology and tools for metadata governance and management for EU Institutions&quot;, developed under the SEMIC action of the ISA Programme: &quot;Whilst technological developments offer various means to automate the exchange of information, technological developments alone cannot guarantee a greater interoperability between information systems. A fundamental aspect is the need for common data standards: primarily data models and reference data [...]&quot;.&#xD;

&#xD;
ESPD - Exchange data model &#xD;
The ESPD exchange data model (ESPD-EDM) is used for the ESPD service provided by the European Commission.&#xD;
The ESPD Exchange Data Model was designed to implement the data requirements expressed in the Annex 2 of the COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/7 of 5 January 2016 (from now on &quot;the Annex to the Regulation 2016/7&quot;), establishing the standard form for the European Single Document. Additionally to these requirements, the model took also into account the Information Requirements Model specified by the CEN/BII-Workshops.[3] (namely Workshop 3), and the latest developments relating to the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) in e-Sens.[4].&#xD;
One premise that has ruled the design and implementation life-cycle of the ESPD-EDM has been ''not to reinvent the wheel''. Thus some very early key decisions were: &#xD;
&#xD;
(i)	select a mature business language for the naming, design and implementation of the ESPD-EDM; &#xD;
(ii)	reuse as much as possible existing information components and libraries ''as-they-are''; &#xD;
(iii)	for those entities that are not defined in any standard specification, design new components in such a way that they can be reused in other situations and domains, both in e-Procurement and beyond e-Procurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
OASIS UBL-2.1 standard was chosen as the best candidate to base the ESPD-EDM upon. The main reasons for this decisions were: &#xD;
i.	The European Commission is already using (and recommending) UBL-2.1 for e-Documents.[5] ; &#xD;
ii.	Most of the concepts and components necessary for the ESPD documents were already defined by UBL specifically for e-Procurement; (3) Methodology and tools are available for the development of new documents, the extension of the existing UBL libraries, the semantic validation of XML instances, etc.&#xD;

eDelivery&#xD;
Supporting secure and reliable exchange of data and documents&#xD;
eDelivery is a network of nodes for digital communications. It is based on a distributed model where every participant becomes a node using standard transport protocols and security policies. eDelivery helps public administrations to exchange electronic data and documents with other public administrations, businesses and citizens, in an interoperable, secure, reliable and trusted way. eDelivery is one of the building blocks of the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU. The CEF eDelivery building block is based on the AS4 messaging protocol, open and free for all, developed by the OASIS standards development organisation. To ease its adoption in Europe, eDelivery uses the AS4 implementation guidelines defined by the Member States in the e-SENS Large Scale Pilot. Organisations must install an Access Point, or use a Service Provider, to exchange information with the AS4 messaging protocol.&#xD;

      <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Shared platform ABB is a Application Component setting technical (re)usable resources with convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from a technical perspective cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. This convergence power is based on the instrumental nature and efficiencies  of these resources for enabling common problem-solving approaches. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared platform (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the technical perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared platform (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the technical perspective). The level of technical interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared platform enables:&#xD;
i)          structural interoperability with technical resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. service registry service);&#xD;
ii)         behavioural interoperability with technical resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Technical interfaces); and&#xD;
iii)        governance interoperability with technical resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge(i.e. Technical Interoperability Agreements).&#xD;

ZooKeeper&#xD;
ZooKeeper is a centralized service registry for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.&#xD;

Enterprise Data Warehouse:&#xD;
An enterprise data warehouse is a strategic repository that provides analytical information about the core operations of an enterprise. It is distinct from traditional data warehouses and marts, which are usually limited to departmental or divisional business intelligence. An enterprise data warehouse (EDW) supports enterprise-wide business needs and at the same time is critical to helping IT evolve and innovate while still adhering to the corporate directive to “provide more functionality with less investment.”&#xD;

Administrative simplification ABB is a Principle improving and simplyfing administration processes when they do not provide public value. Administrative simplification can help businesses and citizens to reduce the administrative burden of complying with EU legislation or national obligations. Likewise, public administrations should introduce European public services supported by electronic means, including their interactions with other public administrations, citizens and businesses.

Digitisation of public services should take place in accordance with the following concepts:
* digital-by-default, whenever appropriate, so that there is at least one digital channel available for accessing and using a given European public service;
* digital-first which means that priority is given to using public services via digital channels while applying the multi-channel delivery concept and the no-wrong-door policy, i.e. physical and digital channels co-exist.

Digital Inclusion ABB is a Principle relating to seamless, transparent, accessible and user-friendly digital government services. Citizens must be able to use such digital services without having legal knowledge. The members of our societies should have the opportunity to help shape the digital transformation and share their ideas and content with others unimpeded, while respecting the rights of third parties. The public sector should encourage such wider participation in policy-making by involving society in the design of public services through co-creation, ex-perimentation and collaboration.&#xD;

Inclusion and accessibility ABB is a Principle enabling everyone to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies to access and make use of European public services, overcoming social and economic divides and exclusion.
Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups can use public services at service levels comparable to those provided to other citizens.

Inclusion and accessibility must be part of the whole development lifecycle of a European public service in terms of design, information content and delivery. It should comply with e-accessibility specifications widely recognised at European or international level.

Inclusion and accessibility usually involve multi-channel delivery. Traditional paper-based or face-to-face service delivery may need to co-exist with electronic delivery.

Inclusion and accessibility can also be improved by an information system’s ability to allow third parties to act on behalf of citizens who are unable, either permanently or temporarily, to make direct use of public services.

          <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Multilingualism ABB is a Principle considering that European public services can potentially be used by anyone in any Member State. Citizens across Europe often have problems in accessing and using digital public services if these are not available in the languages they speak.

A balance needs to be found between the expectations of citizens and businesses to be served in their own language(s) or their preferred language(s) and the ability of Member States’ public administrations to offer services in all official EU languages. 
A suitable balance could be that European public services are available in the languages of the expected end-users, i.e. the number of languages is decided on the basis of users’ needs, such as the level to which the service is critical for the implementation of the digital single market or national policies, or the size of the relevant audience.

Multilingualism comes into play not just in the user interface, but at all levels in the design of European public services. For example, the choices made on data representation in an electronic database should not limit its ability to support different languages.

The multilingual aspect of interoperability becomes also relevant when a public service requires exchanges between information systems across language boundaries, as the meaning of the information exchanged must be preserved.

          <documentation>DEFINITION: &#xD;
Openness ABB is a Principle relating to data, specifications and software, in the context of interoperable public services.

Open government data (here simply referred ‘open data’) refers to the idea that all public data should be freely available for use and reuse by others, unless restrictions apply e.g. for protection of personal data, confidentiality, or intellectual property rights. Public administrations collect and generate huge amounts of data. The Directive on the reuse of public sector information (PSI)7 encourages Member States to make public information available for access and reuse as open data. The INSPIRE Directive8 requires, in addition, sharing of spatial datasets and services between public authorities with no restrictions or practical obstacles to its reuse. This data should be published with as few restrictions as possible and clear licences for its use to allow better scrutiny of administrations’ decision-making processes and realise transparency in practice.

The use of open source software technologies and products can help save development cost, avoid a lock-in effect and allow fast adaptation to specific business needs because the developer communities that support them are constantly adapting them. Public administrations should not only use open source software but whenever possible contribute to the pertinent developer communities. Open source is an enabler of the underlying EIF principle on reusability.

The level of openness of a specification/standard is decisive for the reuse of software components implementing that specification. This also applies when such components are used to introduce new European public services. If the openness principle applies in full:
* all stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the specification and a public review is part of the decision-making process;
* the specification is available for everyone to study;
* intellectual property rights to the specification are licensed on FRAND9 terms, in a way that allows implementation in both proprietary and open source software10, and preferably on a royalty-free basis.

Due to their positive effect on interoperability, the use of open specifications has been promoted in many policy statements and is encouraged for European public service delivery. The positive effect of open specifications is demonstrated by the internet ecosystem. However, public administrations may decide to use less open specifications if open ones do not exist or do not meet functional needs. In all cases, specifications should be mature and sufficiently supported by the market, unless they are being used to create innovative solutions.

Lastly, openness also means empowering citizens and businesses to get involved in the design of new services, to contribute to service improvement and to give feedback about the quality of the existing public services.

This means that records18 and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.

To guarantee the long-term preservation of electronic records and other kinds of information, formats should be chosen to ensure long-term accessibility, including preservation of associated electronic signatures or seals. In this regard, the use of qualified preservation services, in line with Regulation (EU) 910/2014, can ensure the long-term preservation of information.

For information sources owned and managed by national administrations, preservation is a purely national matter. For information that is not strictly national, preservation becomes a European issue. In that case, an appropriate ‘preservation policy’ should be applied by the Member States concerned, to cope with any difficulties arising if the relevant information is used under different jurisdictions.

A reference architecture is a generalized architecture of a solution, based on best-practices, domain neutral and, occasionally, with a focus on a particular aspect. The goal of a reference architecture is reusability; it reduces the amount of work, reduces errors and accelerates the development of solutions. A reference architecture should be based in a [reference] model and in a style. &#xD;
- Architectural framework: a tool for assisting in the production of organization-specific architectures. An architectural framework consists of a technical  reference model, a method for architecture development and a list of component standards, specifications, products and their interrelationships which can be used to build up architectures.&#xD;

          <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Reusability ABB is a principle meaning that, public administrations confronted with a specific problem seek to benefit from the work of others by looking at what is available, assessing its usefulness or relevance to the problem at hand, and where appropriate, adopting solutions that have proven their value elsewhere. This requires the public administration to be open to sharing its interoperability solutions, concepts, frameworks, specifications, tools and components with others.

Reusability of IT solutions (e.g. software components, Application Programming Interfaces, standards), information and data, is an enabler of interoperability and improves quality because it extends operational use, as well as saving money and time. This makes it a major contributor to the development of a digital single market in the EU. Some EU standards and specifications also exist in the DIFs and should be applied more widely. For example, the INSPIRE Directive sets out interoperability standards for addresses, cadastres, roads and many other data topics of relevance to many public administrations. These existing standards and specifications can and should be used more widely beyond the domain for which they were originally developed.

Several public administrations and governments across the EU already promote sharing and reuse of IT solutions by adopting new business models, promoting the use of open source software for key ICT services and when deploying digital service infrastructure.

There are some key challenges that limit the sharing and reuse of IT solutions, at technical, organisational, legal and communication levels. The ISA² sharing and reuse framework for IT solutions12 provides recommendations for public administrations to help them overcome these challenges and share/reuse common IT solutions. Reuse and sharing can be effectively supported by collaborative platforms.

Technological neutrality and data portability ABB is a Principle establishing European public services. Public administrations should focus on functional needs and defer decisions on technology as long as possible in order to minimise technological dependencies, to avoid imposing specific technical implementations or products on their constituents and to be able to adapt to the rapidly evolving technological environment.

Public administrations should provide for access and reuse of their public services and data irrespective of specific technologies or products.

The functioning of the digital single market requires data to be easily transferable among different systems to avoid lock-in, support the free movement of data. This requirement relates to data portability - the ability to move and reuse data easily among different applications and systems, which becomes even more challenging in cross-border scenarios.

Organisational interoperability refers to the way in which public administrations align their business processes, responsibilities and expectations to achieve commonly agreed and mutually beneficial goals. In practice, organisational interoperability means documenting and integrating or aligning business processes and relevant information exchanged. Organisational interoperability also aims to meet the requirements of the user community by making services available, easily identifiable, accessible and user-focused.

Transparency:&#xD;
&#xD;
EIF Transparency Principle refers to:&#xD;
1. Enabling visibility inside the administrative environment of a public administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens and businesses to view and understand administrative rules, processes, data, services and decision-making.&#xD;
2. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems.&#xD;
3. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations.&#xD;

        <documentation>The Key Interoperability Enablers viewpoint models the most salient key interoperability enablers(*). The viewpoint uses the ArchiMate© motivation extension to assess the structural interoperability readiness, the behavioral interoperability readiness and the governance interoperability readiness of solutions that are necessary to enable the efficient and effective delivery of public services across administrations. European public service provision often requires different public administrations to work together to meet end users’ needs and provide public services in an integrated way. When multiple organizations are involved there is a need for coordination and governance by the authorities with a mandate for planning, implementing and operating European public services. Services should be governed to ensure: collaboration, seamless execution, reuse of services and data, and development of new services and ‘building blocks'.&#xD;
 &#xD;
(*)DECISION (EU) 2015/2240 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 November 2015 establishing a programme on interoperability solutions and common frameworks for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA2 programme) as a means for modernising the public sector.&#xD;
 &#xD;
The Key Interoperability Enablers viewpoint covers all EIF interoperability aspects: legal, organisational, semantic and technical. Ensuring interoperability when preparing legal instruments, organisation business processes, data/information/knowledge exchange, services and components that support European interoperable digital public services is a continuous task, as interoperability is regularly disrupted by changes to the environment, i.e. in legislation, the needs of businesses or citizens, the organisational structure of public administrations, the business processes, and by the emergence of new technologies.&#xD;

&#xD;
Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA© that are key enablers for the interoperability of public services:&#xD;
&#xD;
1.	EIF [Interoperability Principles] are used to realise the overall goal of achieving interoperability. &#xD;
&#xD;
2.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieve Legal Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Legal Framework] of [re]usable legal resources that enables:&#xD;
structural interoperability by legal resources supporting reusing and/or sharing legislation (i.e. [Legislation Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming legal texts cross public administrations and cross borders);&#xD;
behavioral interoperability by legal resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Legislation on Data Information and Knowledge Exchange] enabling data/information/knowledge to be provisioned/consumed cross public administrations and cross borders); and&#xD;
governance interoperability by legislation supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Legal Interoperability Agreement] on legal terms assuring juridical certainty enabling agreed legal terms/conditions for sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders). &#xD;
&#xD;
3.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Organisational Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Governance Framework] of [re]usable organisational resources that enables: structural interoperability by organisational resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. [Digital Public Service Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming public services cross public administrations and cross borders); behavioural interoperability by organisational resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Digital Public Service Delivery Model], served by [Digital Public Service Delivery] enabling data/information/knowledge to be provisioned/consumed cross public administrations and cross borders); and governance interoperability by governance resources supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Organisational Interoperability Agreement] on organisational terms/conditions enabling sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders).&#xD;
&#xD;
4.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Semantic Interoperability] is realized by a [Shared Knowledge Base] of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables: structural interoperability by semantic resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of data, information and knowledge (i.e. [Data Set Catalogue], [Ontologies Catalogue] and [Data Mapping Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming data, information and knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders); behavioral interoperability by semantic resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Open Data], [Distributed Ledger] and [Virtual Data Set]; and governance interoperability by semantic resources supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Semantic Interoperability Agreement] on interpretations enabling sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders).  &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Technical Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Platform] of [re]usable ICT resources (i.e. the platform) that enables structural interoperability by ICT resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of data, and that realises [Software component Discovery and catalogue Service], [API Discovery and Catalogue Service], [Service Discovery and Registry Service]; at the same time [Shared Platform] realises also [Machine to Machine], [Human Interface], [Data Exchange Service], [UX Management Service] and [Digital Workplace Service]. [Shared Platform] governance interoperability by ICT resources supports also the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Technical Interoperability Agreements] on technical terms/conditions enabling  provisioning/consuming back-office services cross public administrations and cross borders).</documentation>

        <documentation>The EIRA© Highlevel viewpoint models an introductory overview of the focal Architecture Building Blocks of each view. It aligns the EIRA© with the service delivery model described within the Interoperability Maturity Model  (IMM), and the New European Interoperability Framework (EIF) conceptual model for public services.&#xD;
The ABBs included in the high-level viewpoint represent the points that link the EIRA©’s views enabling traceability between their different Architecture Building Blocks. They are not necessarily mandatory but should always be considered by a user of the EIRA© when executing one of its use cases.&#xD;

The EIRA© with its views provides a set of Architecture Building Blocks, important to facilitate interoperability. Each view, one for each interoperability level, is represented with the Focal Architecture Building Blocks needed to deliver an interoperable solution. These focal Architecture Building Blocks are indicated with an accented colour.&#xD;
In the high-level are represented the ABBs that link the EIRA©’s views enabling navigation between the different views. As such they should be considered as critical components of any interoperable public service. They are not necessarily mandatory but should always be considered by a user of the EIRA© when executing one of its use cases.&#xD;
Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlighting the focal building blocks of the EIRA©: &#xD;
&#xD;
1.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the legal view shows the [Public Policy] is realised by [Legal Act] and [Digital Public Service]; these two ABB, referred to the legal view, are aggregated within the [Shared Legal framework]. [Shared legal Framework] influences [Organisational Functional Content], [Semantic Functional Content], [Technical Application Functional Content].&#xD;
&#xD;
2.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organizational view show a [Shared Governance Framework] that aggregates the [Organizational Functional Content] which considers a [Digital Public Service] which can be an aggregation of other [Digital Public Service]. The [Digital Public Service] realises a [Digital Business Capability]. A [Digital Business Capability] describes key functions supporting the [Digital Public Service]. A [Digital Public Service] accesses [Information], which can be an aggregation of other [Information]. At the same time a [Digital Public Service] is assigned by a [Digital Public Service Delivery] which is connected through a serving relation with the [Digital Public Service Delivery Model].&#xD;
&#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view shows the [Shared Knowledge Base] and that the [Semantic Functional Content] is composed of a [Representation], stored as [Data] and the [Ontology]. &#xD;
&#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical views - application shows that a [Interoperable Digital Solution Service] is composed of a [Digital Solution Service] realized by a [Digital Solution Component] and lets consumers access it via [Machine to Machine Interface] and/or [Human Interface], which are part of a [Application Presentation and Access Enablers]. A [Digital Solution] exposes one or more [Digital Solution Service] via its [Machine to Machine Interface] and/or [Human Interface]. The [Digital Solution] uses [Digital Service Infrastructure] which uses a [Computing Hosting, Networking, and Data Hosting Infrastructure]. &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical views - infrastructure considers the [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure].</documentation>

        <documentation>The Interoperability Security and Privacy viewpoint models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks related to both security and privacy in the domain of interoperability. Citizens and businesses must be confident that when they interact with public authorities they are doing so in a secure and trustworthy environment and in full compliance with relevant regulations, e.g. the Regulation and Directive on data protection, and the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services. Public administrations must guarantee the citizens’ privacy, and the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of information provided by citizens and businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Security and privacy are primary concerns in the provision of public services. When public administrations and other entities exchange official information, the information should be transferred, depending on security requirements, via a secure, harmonised, managed and controlled network. Transfer mechanisms should facilitate information exchanges between administrations, businesses and citizens. Appropriate mechanisms should allow secure exchange of electronically verified messages, records, forms and other kinds of information between the different systems; should handle specific security requirements and electronic identification and trust services such as electronic signatures/seals creation and verification; and should monitor traffic to detect intrusions, changes of data and other type of attacks.&#xD;

Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks from the five different view highlighting the Security and Privacy aspects of the EIRA©: &#xD;
&#xD;
1.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the legal view shows the [Public Policy], which is that mainspring of the solution&#xD;
&#xD;
2.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the organisational view shows the [Security Framework], associated with the [Security Governance] which is that mainspring of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the semantic view shows the [Security Policy], which is that mainspring of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view Application shows that a [Interoperable Digital Solution], which considers [Human Interface] and [Machine to Machine Interface] is supported by a [Shared platform] which uses [Trust Enablers], [Application Security Enablers], [Identification and Access Enablers] and [Data Exchange Enablers]. [Trust Enablers] such as [Integrity Verification Service], [e-Signature Creation Service], [e-Seal Creation Service], [e-Timestamp Creation Service], [e-Signature Verification and Validation Service], [e-Seal Verification and Validation Service], [e-Timestamp Verification and Validation Service], [e-Signature Preservation Service], [e-Seal Preservation Service] and [Registered Electronic Delivery Service], are all realised by a [Trust Service Provisioning Component]. [Identification and Access Enablers] is composed of [Authentication Service], [Request Validation Service] and [Registration Service] which are realised by [Identification Component] and that provides access to the [Directory], accessed also by the [Access Management Service], realised by the [Access Management Component]. [Application Security Enablers] is realised of [Firewall Service], composed of [Firewall Component] and [Audit Service], which is realised by an [Audit Component]. [Data Exchange Enablers] composed of Data Exchange Service] realised by the [Data Exchange Component].&#xD;
&#xD;
5. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view Infrastructure shows an [Outsourcing Facility] and [On - Premise Facility] composed of [Back End Firewall] and [Extranet Firewall]. &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the EIF Underlying Principles view show that [Interoperability Specifications] realises [EIF Principles], the general intended properties used to achieve interoperability, of which the [Security and Privacy] is a specialisation. The interoperability Specifications can be used to define the interoperability aspects for any of the Architecture Building Blocks&#xD;

        <documentation>The Conceptual Model for Integrated Public Service Provisioning promotes reusability as a driver for interoperability, recognising that the European public services should reuse information and services that already exist and may be available from various sources inside or beyond the organisational boundaries of public administrations. Information and services should be retrievable and be made available in interoperable formats. Security and privacy requirements should be considered and measures for the provision of each public service according to risk management plans should be identified. Trust services should be used according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: &#xD;
A [Digital Public Service] is provided via a [Service Delivery Mode]. This [Public Service] can use other [Public Service] to realise a [Digital Business Capability] and are coordinated via [Orchestration Service]. This service use internal or external ([Data], [Digital Solution Services]). Information source and services . [Key Interoperability Enablers] principles apply to the entire conceptual model.</documentation>

        <documentation>The Interoperability Privacy viewpoint highlights the EIRA building blocks that are relevant when implementing the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or assessing an existing architecture against the GDPR principles. Public administrations must indeed guarantee the citizens’ privacy, and the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of information provided by citizens and businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: The selected Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlight the Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA that are that are relevant with respect to GDPR:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the legal view show that privacy requirements are coming from a [Public Policy] realised by a [Binding instrument].&#xD;
&#xD;
2. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organisational view show that the [Privacy Framework] applies to the [Digital Public Service] which is assigned by the [Data Owner] and provided by the [Digital Public Service Provider]. The [Digital Public Service] serves the [Digital Public Service Delivery Consumer], assigned to an [Individual] that is associated to the [Information] accessible though the [Organisation] which is a specialissed by [Public Administration] and [Business].&#xD;
&#xD;
3. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view show that [Data] aggregates [Data Set], [Ontology] and [Data Mapping] and that it is subject to the [Data Policy].&#xD;
&#xD;
4. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the Technical View shows many service involving data impacted by the privacy regulation, such as&#xD;
[Data Extraction,Transformation and Loading Service], [Data Quality Service], [e-Archiving Service], [Data Publication Service], [Data Exchange Service] and [Data Management Service]; all the services reported are realised by their specific Application Component. Additionally, a [Privacy Service], realised by a [Privacy Component] implementing GDPR principle can be used to ensure compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the EIF Underlying Principles view show the [EIF Principle], the general intended properties used to achieve interoperability, of which the [Security and Privacy] is a specialisation. The interoperability Specifications can be used to define the interoperability aspects for any of the Architecture Building Blocks.</documentation>

[Analysis of a target digital public solution] groups the following ABBs: [Interoperability Dimension] which is associated with the [EIRA Architecture Building Blocks] requirement. the [EIRA Architecture Building Blocks] composes the [EIRA View], which is associated with the [EIF Interoperability Level], aggregates the [EIRA Viewpoint] and is a specialization of the [Key Interoperability Enabler] and [Architecture Building Block] which in turn adds granularity to the [Detail - level Architecture Requirement]. The [Detail - level Architecture Requirement] is a specialist ion of the [Interoperability Requirement] which aggregates all the [Interoperability Aspects]. [Analysis of a target digital public solution] is influenced by [Architecture Principle] which is a specialization of the [EIF Principle] and aggregates the [European Library of Architecture Principle]. [Architecture Principle] influences also the [Solution design of a target digital public service / Documentation of an existing digital public service] which is composed by the [EIRA Solution Building Block] that realizes the [Interoperability Specification] and specializes the [Solution Building Block] that, in turn, is composed by the [Digital Solution] which realizes the [Interoperable Digital Solution]. The [Solution Building Block] realizes the [Solution Specification] that is a specialization of the [Interoperability Specification] which aggregates the [EIRA Library of Interoperability Specifications].</documentation>

        <documentation>The Interoperability Governance viewpoint models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that refer to decisions on interoperability frameworks, institutional arrangements, organisational structures, roles and responsibilities, policies, agreements and other aspects of ensuring and monitoring interoperability at national and EU levels. As such, it does not include operational Architecture Building Blocks like interoperability agreements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Interoperability governance is the key to a holistic approach on interoperability, as it brings together all the instruments needed to apply it.&#xD;

&#xD;
Narrative: The selected Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlight the Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA that are related to Interoperability Governance:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the legal view show the [Public Policy Cycle] and the [Legal Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of the [Legal Agreement],&#xD;
&#xD;
2. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organisational view show that [Data Owner] signs [Organisational Agreement] which is a specialisation of the [Organisational Interoperability Agreement] and is composed by the [Framework Agreement] that is a specialisation of the [Specific Agreement] associated with [Means for Public Policy Objectives Convergence assurance]. The [Interoperability Strategy] implements the [Interoperability Framework], which influences the [Security Framework], the [Privacy Framework], the [Interoperable skill] and the [Interoperability governance]. The [Interoperability Governance] is under the responsibility of the [Interoperability Organisational Authority]. [Delegation of powers provisioning Digital Public Services] influences the [Interoperable Digital Public Service Implementation Orientation] which is realised by the [Digitalisation Roadmap] that realises also the [Digital Agenda], that serves the [Interoperability Strategy]. [Digital Agenda] is associated with [Digital Governance], which, in turn, is associated with [Interoperability Framework], [Security Framework] and [Privacy Framework].&#xD;
&#xD;
3. The selected Architecture Building Block of the semantic view show that [Data Policy] and its specialisation [Descriptive Metadata Policy], [Data Portability Policy], [Open Data Policy], [Master Data Policy], [Base Registry Data Policy] and [Reference Data Policy], together with the [Semantic Interoperability Agreement] are the mainstream of the solution governance at semantic level. Within the [Semantic governance Content] it is also considered that the [Semantic Interoperabilty Agreement] is a specialisation of a [Semantic Agreement].&#xD;
&#xD;
4. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view show [Technical Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of the [Technical Agreement], which are the mainspring of the solution governance at technical level.</documentation>

        <documentation>The EIRA© API viewpoint models an introductory overview of the focal Architecture Building Blocks required when modelling an API Interface. &#xD;
The ABBs included in the API viewpoint represent all the required Busilding Block necessary to design an API Interface accessible thoruh a web interface. &#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: &#xD;
A [Client request for service] is made trough [Internet] and it triggers the [Authentication Service] which serves the [Request Validation Service]that triggers the [HTTP(s) Load Balancer] whichin turn triggers all the [Endpoints] related. Each [Endpoint] serves the [Application Service] which triggers the [App Component] that, in turn, triggers the [Data Access Service]. The [Data Access Service] provides access to the [Data Space] which is composed by the [SQL Data Space], [Read - Replica], [NoSQL Data Space] and [Virtual Data Space]. In the moment in which the [Endpoint] is triggered data flows to the [API Response] which is composed by [Data] and [Represenation] accessed by a [Request Validation Service]. The [API Response] triggers the response that is provided to the user who requetd the data in the first instance.</documentation>

      <documentation>The Legal view models the most salient public policy development enablers and implementation instruments that shall be considered in order to support the End to End design of interoperable digital public services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: &#xD;
A [Public Policy] aims at addressing the needs of a group of stakeholders, and it is associated with a [Public Policy Objective]. The policy is formulated and implemented with the help of [Legal Act] which contain [European Legal act] and [National Legal act] in the form of either [Binding Instrument] or [Non-Binding Instrument]. A key type of legislation for behavioral interoperability is the [Legislation on Data Information and Knowledge Exchange] which together with the [Legislation Catalogue] and [Legal Agreement] aggregate a [Shared Legal Framework]. [Legislation Catalogue] aggregates [Legal Act] which contain [European Legal act] and [National Legal act] and realised the [Public Policy] and [Granularity of Legal Requirements]. Also [Legislation on Data Information and Knowledge Exchange] aggregate [Legal Act]. [Legal Interoperability Agreement] are a specialisation of the [Legal Agreements] focused on formalizing governance rules enabling collaboration between digital public services. &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Legal Governance content] and the [Legal Functional content] and have their interoperability aspects defined by [Interoperability Specification].</documentation>

      <documentation>The Technical - Infrastructure view provides an architecture content metamodel for the most salient cross-sectorial infrastructure services, along with the supporting hosting and networking facilities, which shall be considered in order to support technical aspects for the End to End design of Digital Solutions. The difference with the application part of the Technical view is that the Architecture Building Blocks in the infrastructure view are considered to be relevant for solutions in any sector of government.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: &#xD;
A [Digital  Solution Service] which give access to [Data] is realized by [Digital Solution Component] which is serving by [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure] and realized by [Outsourcing] which serve [Server].[Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure] providing all the necessary networks through [Application Service], [Data Access Service], [Intranet Service],[Remote Desktop Service],[VPN Service] and [Web Service].[Application Service] is assigned by [Application Interface] and realized by [Host Application] which is a composed of [Application Interface] and with [Application Server Software Environment] its part of [Application Server]. [Application Server] is associating with [Enterprise Service Bus] which flow information  with [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure].Also [High Performance Server] is a specialization of [Application Server]. [Data Access Service] is assigned with [Data Interface]. Also have access to [Data Space] and realized by [Host Data Management]. [Data Virtualization] is specialization of [Host Data Management] which is serving by [Data Server Software Environment]. [Triplestone], [Data Hub], [Data Lake] and [Data Warehouse] are specialization of [Data Space].[Data Space] and  [Host Data Management] are part of [Data Server] which associate with [Back end Firewall] which associate with [Enterprise Service Bus]. [Intranet Servise] is assigned with [Intranetwork Service] which is composed by [Intranet Application] which serves by [Intranet Server Environment] and realizes [Intranet Service], which have access to [Intranet Website], which have associate with [Intranet Application Database]. Both [Intranet Website] and [Intranet Application] are part of [Intranet Server] which associate with [Enterprise Service Bus].[Remote Desktop Service] is assigned with [Remote Desktop Interface] which is composed by [Remote Desktop Server], which realize [Remote Desktop Service] and associate with [Enterprise Service Bus]. [VPN] Service] assigned with [VPN Interface] which composed by [VPN Application] which served by [VPN Server Environment] which associate with [VPN Path] which realized [VPN Service]. Also [VPN Path] associate with [VPN Client] which is part of [VPN Client Device].[VPN Application] is part of [Virtual Private Network Server] which associate with [Extranet Firewall] which associate with [Entersprise Service Bus]. [VPN Path] is part of the [Internet] which associate with [Sensors] and [Smart Devices]. [Web Service] are assigned with [Internet Interface] which is composed by [Web Application] which realizes [Web Service] and serving by [Web Server Environment], which have access to [External Website] which have associate with [External Application Database].[ External Website],[External Web Application Database], [Web Application] and [Front-end Firewall] are part of [Web Server] which associate with [Internet].All this [Technology Infrastructure Functional Content] is influenced by [Shared Legal Framework] which influence the [Technical Agreement] which composed by [Specific Agreement] and associate with [Digital Public Service Delivery Provider] and [Digital Public Service Delivery Consumer].&#xD;
&#xD;
The Architecture Building Blocks defined in both the [Digital Service Infrastructure] and the [Computing Hosting, Networking, and Data Hosting Infrastructure] can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Solution Specification] is a specialization.&#xD;

      <documentation>The Organisational view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that shall be considered in order to support organisational aspects for the End to End design of Digital Public Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:  [Digital Public Service] is delivered according to its [Digital Service Delivery Model] and realizes a [Digital Business Capability] by accessing [Information] given by a [representation] in conjunction with an [ontology] that enables the enactment of [information] in a given digital public service context. [Digital Public Service] is documented in [Digital Public Service Catalogue] that can be used among others for service portfolio management. The [Digital Public Service Catalogue]  aggregate the [Shared Governance Framework] as the [Organisational  Agreement] and the [Digital Service Delivery Model]. [Digital Public Delivery Model] is composed by [Digital Public Service Delivery Machine Agent] and [Digital Public Service Delivery Human Agent] which both serves a role  [Agent]. [Agent] is assigned with a stakeholder [Legal Entity] which is the specialization of other stakeholders such us [Organization] and [Individual]. [Organization] is also a specialization of [Public Administration] and [Business]. An [Agent] can act both like [Digital Public Service Provider] and [Digital Public Service Delivery Consumer]. Both of roles are aggregated with [Digital Public Service Delivery]. [Organisational Agreement], of which [Organisational Interoperability Agreement] is a specialisation. Also [Framework Agreement] is composed with [Organizational Agreement] which also associate with [Data Owner] and [Digital Governance] which is a specilization of [Security Governance]. The [Digital Governance] associate with [Interoperability Framework], [Security Framework], and [Privacy Framework]. Also [Digital Governance] is associate with [Digital Agenda] which is a realization of [Digitalization Roadmap] which realize the [Interoperable Public Service Implementation Orientation].&#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Organisational Governance content] and [Organisational Functional content] and each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Solution Specification] is a specialisation. Both the contents are defined by [Architecture Requirement], of which the [Interoperability Requirement] is a specialization.</documentation>

      <documentation>The Semantic view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that should be considered in order to support semantic aspects for the End to End design of interoperable Digital Public Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: [Data] is stored as [Representation]. [Data] can be grouped in [Data Sets], which can be documented in [Data Set Catalogues] or in [Ontology] which can be grouped in [Ontologies Catalogue] or in [Data Mappings] which can be grouped in [Data Mapping Catalogue].[Virtual Data Set] are composed with [Data Set] and [Base Registry], [Reference Data] and [ Data Policies] are specialization of [Data Set].[Metadata] is a specialization of [Data].[Forms Strictures], [Data Syntax], [Data Model], [Controlled Vocabulary] and [Hash Code] are specialization of [Metadata] . [Open Data] are specialization of [Data], and [Legal Act Representation] is specialization of Representation]. [Data] has a specific [Data Owner] that is responsible of its management, together with [Digital Public Service Delivery Consumer] and [Digital Public Service Delivery Provider Provider] and all negotiate and reach a [Semantic Agreement] and/or a [Semantic Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of [Semantic Agreement].Also [Specific Agreement] is composed with [Semantic Agreement]. [Data] is subject to [Data Policy], which also influence its [Representation]. Specific cases of [Data Policy] are [Master Data Policy], [Data portability Policy], [Open Data Policy], [Privacy Policy] and [Security Policy]. [Data], [Data Policy] and [Semantic Agreement] are aggregated with [Shared Knowledge Base]&#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Semantic Functional content] and [Semantic Governance Content], each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Architecture Requirement] associated, of which [Solution Specification] is a realisation. The [Interoperability Specification], which is a specialisation of [Solution Specification], is divided in [Data Model], of which [Core Data Model] and [Data Entities] are specialisations, [Controlled Vocabulary] and [Data Syntax].</documentation>

  <purpose>This file provides the ArchiMate model of the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA). The EIRA has been developed in the context of Action of the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA2) Programme. The EIRA is a reference architecture focused on the End to End design of interoperable digital public service. It is composed of the most important architecture building blocks needed for the delivery of digital public services, realise digital business capabilties for public administrations and promote cross-border and cross-sector interactions between public administrations. The EIRA is a Service Oriented Architecture and uses ArchiMate as a modelling notation. The EIRA implements the New European Interoperability Framework (EIF). 

The latest release of the EIRA is available on Joinup: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/eia/description 
The latest release of the new EIF is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en</purpose>
