The packages are in contract level, so the information is at Pass as golden source. We need to ask Pass team to add that information at merchant grouping level.
Pros: when we will deco the portal onboarding from pass/meon and add it to C_IAM, no dependency on the contract/merchant creation. We only need to stop Pass gui/Meon creation and sync the users into Mepo.
Retrofit to Europe :
Impact : the europeen users have a alias_user : code as login and not using the address email like marcopolo ones.
When we will do the migration, we will need to set up some config/script of migration :
Notification to users that they will need to use address email instead of user_alias
Manage the users in the same company with the same email address (we need some figures to adapt the communication or script to set up). *
Redirection of the loging page into ciam and redirection again into the welcomepage of Myportal.
Migration within steps to be managed.",""
