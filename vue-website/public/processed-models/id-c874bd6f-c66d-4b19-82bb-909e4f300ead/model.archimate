It's up to the owner, the service domain that created the position, to understand the context of the position. Authorisation of the entry is delegated to/handled by the owning service domain. Position Keeping manages the changes to the balance, but the actual computation of interest is left to the owner of the position.</documentation>

General comment:
The handling of commission payments can be very complex as different commission entitlements and volume thresholds can apply and commission entitlements can occur at different stages in the life-cycle of a product or service (e.g. at initial agreement/sale, on set-up, at some stage during fulfillment). Furthermore commission entitlements can be reversed in some situations and the agreement and payment mechanisms vary for different types of employee/associate. This service domain captures a general commission transaction at the product/service level and assumes that the Commission Agreement service domain provides the appropriate business rules for determining the entitlement, timing, amount and mechanism for payment.

General comment:
This candidate service domain is a place holder for a potentially complex array of service domain capabilities needed to manage interbank, merchant relationships and financial capture networks needed to fully support a card product. This is a specialized activity typically outsourced by most banks and so is currently modeled as a 'gateway' relationship rather than a complete range of service domains. In addition to the merchant agreement that determines the transactional fees/terms and rules for dispute resolution, the merchant relationship needs to handle their side of disputes, operation of the merchant network and distributed facilities and some aspects of card inventory management. Note: the internal working of the merchant and financial capture network is not covered in the current release of the BIAN model</documentation>

Trades can be routed and executed in the appropriate exchange individually or it is possible for some situations that a more sophisticated batching &amp; netting approach can be considered as appropriate. The facility can embed structured access to Market Data Dissemination Administration and Market Data Dissemination Operation service domains for subscription market data feeds as necessary. The customer agreement and service access mechanisms use the standard Customer Agreement, Party Profile &amp; E-Branch service domains for access and execution.</documentation>

General comment:
Interactive help is a service to provide on-line context specific guidance, typically for any machine assisted activity. It can help reduce training overheads and ensure operational consistency by providing clear and succinct guidance that is directly relevant to the task at hand. Interactive help is particularly useful in areas where there is constant change, such as active sales/campaigns or where often quite simple but extensive information is handled such as product specifications/rules. It is also a powerful lever to support self service when the guidance can be pitched for customers rather than specialist members of the workforce. Interactive help should be available cross channel and media and the access/use of interactive help should be tracked to provide additional insight into root cause analysis</documentation>

General comment:
The Customer dialogue handling capability provides a highly structured orchestration capability to leverage any customer interaction by consolidating customer related data and using the session (and any additional intelligence and context data gleaned during the dialogue) to leverage the interaction. In a more advance implementation the customer interaction capabilities could be integrated into an automated self/service context in addition to the more conventional CSR support utility. The structured customer dialogue leverages the opportunity by checking for other business activities that may be worked into the session for example, delivering pending communications, sales/marketing, capturing intelligence/triggers, updating status, product fulfillment (such as synchronizing customer-side data sets).

Comment: 
It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position .
The term &quot;account&quot; is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,
Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.
A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash , there is
a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased)
an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased)

An account can be assign to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly wel assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.

Examples: 
stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...
Bank Account BE12 1234 5678 9012 : is an individual banking account
Accounts Payable , is a collective account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to suppliers . This account is managed usually in a General Ledger 
Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a sub-ledger.
Stock Account x , is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts in stock of a specific good.</documentation>

      <documentation>A behavior or mechanism that can be applied to some asset in the execution of commercial business
Comments
The business role or purpose of a ServiceDomain is characterized by its FunctionalPattern.  BIAN has identified 18 generic FunctionalPatterns  that can be applied to assets.  For example, the asset of a computer can be operated, an employee can be assigned, a relationship can be managed.  
A ServiceDomain is responsible for implementing its particular FunctionalPattern on each instance of its associated AssetType for the full life cycle.  So, for example, the ServiceDomain that 'manages' customer relationships is responsible for doing so for every customer relationship from the first time the customer is identified to the last time the customer has involvement with the bank.
Examples
Design, Direct, Manage, Register -- these are some of the FunctionalPatterns currently defined.</documentation>

Comment
Generic behaviors for a ServiceDomain are generated according to the ServiceDomain's FunctionalPattern. A ServiceDomain has a generic ServiceOperation corresponding to each of its generic, FunctionalPattern-based behaviors. BehaviorQualifiers are used to define additional ServiceOperations.
Example
Consider the ServiceDomain named Product Broker Agreement, whose FunctionalPattern is Agree Terms.   The generic behaviors for ServiceDomains that conform to the Agree Terms FunctionalPattern correspond to the following Actions: Evaluate, Initiate, Notify, Retrieve, and Update.
initiateBrokerAgreement is therefore one of the generic ServiceOperations for this ServiceDomain; this operation is structured according to the following semantic grammar, which applies to all generic ServiceOperations:
&lt;action>&lt;control record>
where &lt;action> = initiate and &lt;control record> = BrokerAgreement.
BehaviorQualifiers named &quot;Legal Terms&quot; and &quot;Regulatory Terms&quot; are used to define more specific operations named initiateBrokerAgreementLegalTerms and initiateBrokerAgreementRegulatoryTerms, according to the following semantic grammar:
&lt;action>&lt;control record>&lt;behavior qualifier>

For the Product Broker ServiceDomain, BehaviorQualifiers named &quot;Legal Terms&quot; and &quot;Regulatory Terms&quot; are applied to define more specific operations named initiateBrokerAgreementLegalTerms and initiateBrokerAgreementRegulatoryTerms.</documentation>

Comment
BIAN has defined the likely assets found in any bank and uses this approach to isolate the specific types of asset that are acted on by the ServiceDomains. The role or purpose of each and every ServiceDomain is to apply its specific functional pattern to instances of one type of asset.
Is the tangible or intangible item that can have associated 'replacement' value/worth and purpose/use for which the bank has ownership or some level of control. It is exploited/leveraged in the execution of business through the application of some business behavior/control as effected by a ServiceDomain. Some asset types are obvious - for example a machine or building, some are intangible but easily identified such as knowhow, knowledge, relationships, reputation. Some are less obvious - most common is the 'capacity to perform' type which applies to many BIAN Service Domains. For example in the case of product fulfillment and support activities like party authentication the asset is the bank's possession of the capacity to perform these activities - the combination of the people/processes/systems to execute if you will...</documentation>

Comment 
BIAN has identified a standard set of Actions that characterize the different types of ServiceOperations.  Each ServiceOperation executes exactly one Action.  There are currently 15 standard actions terms.
Examples
Currently the full list of Actions is as follows: Register, Initiate, Activate, Create, Configure, Update, Feedback, Execute, Evaluate, Provide, Grant, Request, Control, Notify, Retrieve.


A Capability is the capacity of a ServiceDomain to fulfill a Responsibility that it owns without relying on other Service Domains.

E.g. Incoming or outgoing credit transfers are processed immeditatly, loan payments and the debitation of the related current account are executed at the same moment. 

This reduces reconciliation and correction effort and improves customer service. Customer of M4 Bank (and Homeland subgroup) are used to this service level. Evolution on European level is towards &quot;instant&quot;. 

As a consequenc, a minimum requirement is direct interaction with current account services, as this position is most change prone. Working on a duplicated current account balance is not acceptable.</documentation>

When the same information is created/updated in different Systems of Entry, the resuting data are often conflicting. This means a lot of effort has top be invested in data quality. 

Data should be managed in one master data store, data update services should be reused by all applicaions that require updating these data. Data consuling services are managed centrally. Data duplication services may be part of such service catalogue if and only if the information quality requirements allow for the frequency service levels of such service.

      <documentation>A BIANBusinessArea is formed by a broad set of capabilities and responsibilities and lies at the highest level of the service landscape hierarchy.  BIANBusinessAreas are used to decompose the functions of financial institutions. This decomposition is primarily driven by business understanding and complemented by application and information-specific needs.
Comments
    &quot;BIAN&quot; was added to the name of this class in order to make its distinction from ISO20022 MessageComponent obvious, but it was not strictly necessary for disambiguation since two UML classes can have the same unqualified name as long as they are in separate packages.  Note that, unlike other cases where &quot;BIAN&quot; has been added to the name of an element of the BIAN Metamodel to distinguish the element from an ISO 20022 element, in this case BIANBusinessArea is not a subtype of ISO 20022's BusinessArea element; ISO 20022 BusinessAreas are normatively defined by ISO and have a certain structure defined by the ISO 20022 Metamodel, whereas BIANBusinessAreas are non-normatively defined by BIAN as a vehicle -- along with BusinessDomains -- for organizing the BIAN Service Domains; conformance with BIAN does not require adopting BIAN's specific hierarchy of BIANBusinessAreas and BusinessDomains, said hierarchy being merely a reference model.
    
    BIAN has identified (amongst others) the following BIANBusinessAreas as part of BIAN's reference model of business areas and business domains: ○
    Reference Data○
    Sales &amp; Service○
    Operations &amp; Execution○
    Analytics○
    Business Support
    BusinessAreas are decomposed (i.e. subdivided) into Business Domains.
    BusinessAreas are part of the Service Landscape of BIAN.</documentation>

      <documentation>link met plateau is nodig (aggregatie)om matrix te kunnen genereren. Dit heeft zijn beperkingen (je kan relaties niet linken aan een plateau), dus vb dat een dienst van land  verandert kan je niet wergeven zonder een ander &quot;dienst&quot; te creeren.

      <documentation>De wijzigingen aan het pmts proces betreffen de orchstratie: deze wordt STP. 

De informatie service van &quot;current account&quot; wijzigen op zich niet, maar de sneheid waarmee ze gevraagd kunnen worden wel. In feite wijzigen de service levels - het &quot;service contract&quot; - dus de service... Wij geven dit hier weer door het &quot;proces&quot; . Op applicatief niveau zullen we de service zelf aanpassen:een message of een batch is niet hetzelfde. ????

waarom verandert current account movement authorisation? Omdat er ook &quot;dummy&quot; accounts zullen zijn. Dat vraagt een andre manier van authoriseren. 

Waarom verandert &quot;posting schem orchastration&quot; niet, ondanks de komst van dummy accounts? Omdat dit de zorg van position keeping niet is. Die ziet gewoon een schema en rekeningen.</documentation>

      <documentation>Every Bank has a Banking Strategy to realize the Banks Strategic Goals. 
BIAN's Business Capability Model is a general accepted reference model of business capabilities that are needed to make a bank a bank. The Organization specific Banking Business Capability model will support the Banking Strategy.
A Banking Strategy is, amongst others, supported by an Information System Strategy. Often the principles of no-redundancy of data and functionality is expressed.
The Information System Strategy type that BIAN proposes is to decompose the Bank into a number of Mutual Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) Service Domains. 
These Service Domains are banking capabilities from the structuring perspective of the Information System Strategy. This terminology creates confusion. So BIAN will use the word &quot;Capability&quot; to refer to the &quot;Business Capability&quot; and use the word &quot;Capacity&quot; when talking about a &quot;Service Domain&quot;.
When defining a Service Domain, subject matter experts deliver a number of Business Scenario's . A business Scenario is an interaction between multiple service operations that together realize the objective of the scenario. A business scenario is actually realizing a business service. The interaction between the service operations is expressed by sending and receiving messages to and from service operations. These messages contain data about business objects and bring this data in a specific context so that the message get meaning for the service operation. All the Service Operation interactions expressed by the incoming and outgoing messages represent the life-cycle information about an instance of an Asset Type. The type of information to capture the life-cycle data of an instance of an asset is called a &quot;Control Record&quot;. A Control record captures all the life-cycle data of an Asset Type. An Asset Type is a classification of a composition of one or more business objects, together having value for the business. 
Each component of the Asset Type has information that can be expressed in a so called &quot;Behavior Qualifier&quot;, which is in itself an expression information about business objects in context.  All information expressing information about objects in context belong to the Business Information Layer. The business objects independent from functional context are defined in the Business Object layer. 

The Business Object Layer will be the foundation for an Enterprise Wide Information Model. 
The Business Information Layer will carry information that is derived from Business Object characteristics and their relationships. The Control Record, Analytical Objects, Behavior Qualifiers, Asset-Types, Messages, Business Documents, Reports, Balanced Score Cards, Dash Boards, etc. belong to this layer. Information is the life blood of the running enterprise. So information will support the dynamics of the Bank , which is expressed at the behavior layer. To this layer belong the conepts of Business Scenario's, Banking Business Capabilities and Service Domains.</documentation>
