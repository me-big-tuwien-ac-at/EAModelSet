Target audience of the APIs are application developers, hence an API registry requires and supports publishers to cater to their expectations such as social features and the ability to subscribe and get an access token.

From an API governance point of view, API publishers should be able to secure the APIs by providing access control to the APIs and resources inside the APIs. Some APIs might require additional control with entitlement and workflow support to get approval for subscriptions before providing an access token.

Data storage is a central piece in an IoT platform. The
management of device data brings the requirements for databases to a new level:

 1. Volume. The amount of data that needs to be stored can be massive. In many IoT solutions only the minority of the generated data can be stored.
 2. Variety. Different devices and different sensor types produce very different forms of data.
 3. Velocity. Many IoT cases require the analysis of streaming data to make instant decisions.
 4. Veracity. In some instances, sensors produce ambiguous and inaccurate data.


An IoT platform therefore usually comes with a cloudbased database solution that is distributed across different sensor nodes. It should be scalable for big data and should be able to store both structured (SQL) and
unstructured data (NoSQL).",""

Nettsiden har allerede lagret kortinformasjonen din, så hele kjøpet er gjennomført på to klikk. Leverandøren har også en app som også er like enkel å handle fra.
