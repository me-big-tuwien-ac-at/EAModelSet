A ServiceDomain is responsible for implementing its particular FunctionalPattern on each instance of its associated AssetType for the full life cycle.  So, for example, the ServiceDomain that 'manages' customer relationships is responsible for doing so for every customer relationship from the first time the customer is identified to the last time the customer has involvement with the bank.

Comment: 
It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position .
The term ""account"" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,
Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.
A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash , there is
a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased)
an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased)

An account can be assign to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly wel assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.

Examples: 
stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...
Bank Account BE12 1234 5678 9012 : is an individual banking account
Accounts Payable , is a collective account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to suppliers . This account is managed usually in a General Ledger 
Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a sub-ledger.
Stock Account x , is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts in stock of a specific good.

Generic behaviors for a ServiceDomain are generated according to the ServiceDomain's FunctionalPattern. A ServiceDomain has a generic ServiceOperation corresponding to each of its generic, FunctionalPattern-based behaviors. BehaviorQualifiers are used to define additional ServiceOperations.
Example
Consider the ServiceDomain named Product Broker Agreement, whose FunctionalPattern is Agree Terms.   The generic behaviors for ServiceDomains that conform to the Agree Terms FunctionalPattern correspond to the following Actions: Evaluate, Initiate, Notify, Retrieve, and Update.
initiateBrokerAgreement is therefore one of the generic ServiceOperations for this ServiceDomain; this operation is structured according to the following semantic grammar, which applies to all generic ServiceOperations:
<action><control record>
where <action> = initiate and <control record> = BrokerAgreement.

BIANBusinessAreas are used to decompose the functions of financial institutions. This decomposition is primarily driven by business understanding and complemented by application and information-specific needs.
Comments
    ""BIAN"" was added to the name of this class in order to make its distinction from ISO20022 MessageComponent obvious, but it was not strictly necessary for disambiguation since two UML classes can have the same unqualified name as long as they are in separate packages.  Note that, unlike other cases where ""BIAN"" has been added to the name of an element of the BIAN Metamodel to distinguish the element from an ISO 20022 element, in this case BIANBusinessArea is not a subtype of ISO 20022's BusinessArea element; ISO 20022 BusinessAreas are normatively defined by ISO and have a certain structure defined by the ISO 20022 Metamodel, whereas BIANBusinessAreas are non-normatively defined by BIAN as a vehicle -- along with BusinessDomains -- for organizing the BIAN Service Domains; conformance with BIAN does not require adopting BIAN's specific hierarchy of BIANBusinessAreas and BusinessDomains, said hierarchy being merely a reference model.
    
    BIAN has identified (amongst others) the following BIANBusinessAreas as part of BIAN's reference model of business areas and business domains: ○
    Reference Data○
    Sales & Service○
    Operations & Execution○
    Analytics○
    Business Support
    BusinessAreas are decomposed (i.e. subdivided) into Business Domains.
    BusinessAreas are part of the Service Landscape of BIAN.
