A contingency is the loss or failure of a small part of the power system (e.g. a transmission line), or the loss/failure of individual equipment such as a generator or transformer. Contingency analysis is an application function that uses a simulated model of the power system, to:
• evaluate the effects, and
• calculate any overloads,
resulting from each contingency.
Contingency Analysis is essentially a ""preview"" analysis tool. It simulates and quantifies the results of problems that could occur in the power system in the immediate future.
CA is used as a study tool for the off-line analysis of contingency events, and as an on-line tool to show operators what would be the effects of future outages. This allows operators to be better prepared to react to outages by using pre-planned recovery scenarios.
