      <documentation>The IT plan is a practical document that defines departmental IT directions, strategies, architecture and HR capacity and how these work together to achieve departmental business and government-wide strategic objectives. The IT plan is to support the effective resource allocation and investment planning decisions of the department through the departmental investment planning process. The IT plan reflects departmental priorities and outlines planned investments, including any acquired services, for the upcoming five-year period (at a minimum) in the following areas:
	- New IT projects, systems, services or large enhancements to existing projects, systems and services;
	- Planned maintenance of or enhancements to existing IT systems or services; and
	- IT operations.
The IT plan is reviewed annually and updated as required at the time of the review. The plan, at a minimum, addresses governance, IT business, performance measures and risk management.</documentation>

      <documentation>IT plays a role in enabling departmental business outcomes in the context of Section 12.1.
IT architecture, including but not limited to defined core IT competencies, technology choices and services, should support business outcomes.
IT should be aligned with departmental and government-wide IT priorities, technology, and common and shared services, when such services are available and appropriate.
Resource allocation targets are to be organized into the following four portfolio classes:
	- Innovation – resource allocations that focus on transforming the department's business model;
	- Business opportunity – resource allocations that realize measurable business benefits (e.g., revenue or service growth);
	- Maintenance – resource allocations designed to maintain existing service levels (e.g., ongoing operation of IT); and
	- Mandatory – resource allocations required for legal or regulatory compliance.
