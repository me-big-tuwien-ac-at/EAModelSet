Along with this are key changes, which produce new expectations for Deputy Heads in the areas of service, information and data, technology, cyber security, as well as workforce capacity and capability. To comply with the Policy, a methodological gap analysis was performed by IITB teams to determine the policy-driven requirements based on five themes: 
 Governance, planning and reporting (as it relates to IT governance and planning within ESDC);
 Service Design and Delivery;
 Information and Data;
 Technology (including automated decision making); and,
 Cyber Security and Identity.
The gap analysis looked at IITB’s existing investments and priorities and made 12 recommendations for IITB to either create new initiatives or reprioritize its portfolio of activities. Most of these recommendations are already in progress as part of the IITB Way Forward. The top five prioritized recommendations are:
 Clarify the role and responsibilities between the CDO and the CIO;
 Establish the role of a designated official for Cyber Security (DOCS);
 Review IM/IT and Identity Policies to address redundancy, conflicts, user-centered policy writing, and training;
 Harmonize the different service inventories for a single source of truth; and,
 Formalize automated decision-making governance at ESDC.
These recommendations reflect the integrated management of functions as expected by the Policy, the increased responsibilities of the CIO, and the unique governance entities within ESDC (e.g. use of a CDO, a Chief Security Officer outside the branch of the CIO, and a tier 2 level committee focused on purely on service). 
In addition, the Branches within the Department have been collaborating internally to improve service delivery and digital transformation:
 Business Architecture and Alignment Office participates regularly at EA activities as one of the EA domains in developing project architectures; 
 User Experience Team provides UX research and design services to IT project teams regularly; and,
 Business Process Management Team provides guidance and services on business process mapping to IT project teams regularly.",""

permissions of those groups. All users and groups are managed by account administrators.

Description (Purpose of business)    
The on-going need to modify a large number of existing correspondence systems to meet changing business requirements, along with the desire to discontinue the creation of custom applications for each business line, ESDC’s Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) seeks to implement an enterprise-wide correspondence solution to allow Service Canada and ESDC to receive and disseminate data through multiple and varied channels - print (mail), fax, email, SMS (text) or Web (html).

This solution would allow flexibility to meet both internal and external needs quickly and to manage correspondence based on business needs, as well as decouple the systems integration needs from business processes and rules.  Therefore as business rules change the entire system does not have to change, rather one system process.  This would allow for the implementation of a solution that can be reused by all business lines as well as easily adjustable to future system and business changes.

"id-5be76eef68f544bfbefc4e5cecc7b008","Assessment","Account Access Issues (Assessment)","2.2 Problem/Opportunity
The CSLP has been unable to resolve certain account access issues affecting users of its National Student Loan Services Centre (NSLSC) portal since the program on boarded to the credentials and ECAS in April 2018. There are three main problems facing its clients: 
• At least 30,000 NSLSC accounts are now locked out, and that number increases each day. The causes for this include:
o GCKey username and password credentials are being forgotten by clients, thus preventing successful NSLSC login and contributing to the increasing tally of account lockouts.
o NSLSC security questions and answers are being forgotten by clients, thus preventing successful credential substitution, and sustaining the account lockout tally.
• MSFAA (Master Student Financial Assistance Agreement) for identity verification, as enabled by the Finastra vendor, is constrained to a single-use activation. NSLSC requires consuming one activation upon initial registration of the student. 

Note: Although CSLP has determined this to be the root cause for the business problems defined in this requirements document, it is not feasible to change the Finastra solution; therefore, the corrective action must start with the ECAS product. 
• PAC method (i.e., re-registering the NSLSC account using credential substitution) for identity verification is a capability currently unavailable to NSLSC. 

Note: The program (CSLP) is in the process of evaluating the use of PAC as an alternative identity validation channel. 
The consequences of these account access issues include:
• Negatively affected CSLP reputation (due to limitations of IT-enabled services).
• Inability of clients (i.e., students) to access student loan status, balance, services, etc.
• Increased call volume managed by the R&A and CSLP (NSLSC support) to manage these issues.
In response to these challenges, this SDIV-MVP2 CSLP initiative seeks to: 
Augment the ECAS component by integrating SDIV with the capability to substitute credentials on NSLSC accounts, which will enable affected students to unlock their accounts. 
The integration of SDIV as a service to CSLP in the NSLSC product would provide an alternate identity verification provider to support client credential substitution for the following scenario:
- NSLSC account login credentials and/or security Q&A’s are forgotten by the client user.
SDIV integrated within NSLSC (SDIV-MVP2 CSLP initiative) is consistent with BDM and ESDC transformational business needs in addition to addressing current operational needs with respect to regaining access to locked client accounts. Additionally, providing a rapid identity verification experience to users seeking to substitute their credentials. The SDIV-MVP2 CSLP solution will support service transformation across ESDC by providing a high-quality service experience which enables clients to access loan information and other services in a more timely and accessible manner.
As a result, ESDC must assess new and adaptive technologies that will allow CLSP to provide a feasible alternative to the identity verification option to all students who wish to re-register and access their NSLSC account.",""

Madame la Ministre,

Je vous remercie d’avoir accepté de servir les Canadiens en tant que ministre de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social.

Depuis le début de la pandémie, les Canadiens ont dû faire face à un défi qui ne se produit qu’une fois par siècle. Malgré tout, les gens ont su se montrer à la hauteur, et ce, d’un océan à l’autre. Lorsque cela comptait le plus, les Canadiens se sont adaptés, se sont entraidés et ont fait preuve de compassion, de courage et de détermination, autant de valeurs qui nous sont chères. C’est ce qui a défini jusqu’à présent notre parcours dans cette pandémie. Et c’est ce qui nous permettra d’aller de l’avant.

En cette période difficile, les Canadiens se sont prononcés de façon démocratique. Ils nous ont confié le soin de terminer la lutte contre la COVID-19 et de soutenir le rétablissement d’une classe moyenne forte. Ils nous ont, par le fait même, donné une orientation claire : prendre des mesures audacieuses et concrètes afin de bâtir un avenir où la santé et la résilience prévaudront. C’est ce que les Canadiens nous ont demandé, et c’est exactement ce que notre gouvernement est prêt à faire. Nous nous emploierons à bâtir cet avenir meilleur en continuant de miser sur la collaboration, la mobilisation, la science et la prise de décisions fondées sur des données probantes. En nous appliquant sans relâche à obtenir des résultats, nous travaillerons de manière constructive avec les parlementaires et maintiendrons nos solides partenariats avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, les administrations municipales et nos partenaires autochtones. Le début de cette nouvelle décennie a été extrêmement difficile, mais le moment est venu de rebâtir un pays plus résilient, plus inclusif et plus fort pour tous.

La science est claire. Les Canadiens ont été clairs. Nous devons non seulement continuer d’agir concrètement à l’égard des changements climatiques, mais aussi le faire plus vite et aller plus loin à ce chapitre. Comme les Canadiens le constatent de plus en plus partout dans le pays, les changements climatiques constituent une menace existentielle. Afin de bâtir un avenir plus propre et plus vert, il nous faudra tous faire des efforts soutenus et concertés. Je m’attends à ce que vous cherchiez au sein de votre portefeuille, en votre qualité de ministre, des façons de soutenir nos efforts pangouvernementaux visant à réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, à créer des emplois propres et à relever les défis liés au climat avec lesquels les collectivités composent déjà.

Cette année, les Canadiens ont été horrifiés par la découverte de sépultures non identifiées près d’anciens pensionnats autochtones. Ces découvertes nous rappellent la nécessité d’accélérer la réconciliation avec les Premières Nations, les Inuits et les Métis. Nous savons que cette réconciliation ne peut se faire sans l’obtention de la vérité, et le gouvernement continuera d’investir dans la quête de cette vérité. À titre de ministres, nous avons le devoir de faire progresser les travaux à cet égard, tant collectivement qu’individuellement. Par conséquent, je demande à chaque ministre de mettre en œuvre la Déclaration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones et de travailler en partenariat avec les Autochtones pour faire mieux reconnaître leurs droits.

Nous devons continuer de nous attaquer aux inégalités et aux disparités systémiques profondes qui demeurent présentes dans notre tissu social, notamment au sein de nos institutions fondamentales. À cet égard, il faut que les Canadiens de chacune des régions du pays puissent se reconnaître dans les priorités de notre gouvernement et dans ce que nous réalisons. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez, en votre qualité de ministre, avec diverses communautés dans un souci d’inclusion et cherchiez activement à obtenir les divers points de vue des Canadiens et à les intégrer dans votre travail. Cela comprend les femmes, les Autochtones, les Canadiens noirs et racisés, les nouveaux arrivants, les groupes confessionnels, les personnes en situation de handicap et les Canadiens LGBTQ2. Bien entendu, le tout doit se faire dans le respect des deux langues officielles.

Dans tous les aspects de notre travail, nous continuerons de nous assurer que les politiques publiques sont élaborées dans une perspective intersectionnelle, notamment par l’application de l’analyse comparative entre les sexes plus (ACS Plus) et des indicateurs de qualité de vie dans la prise de décisions.

Les Canadiens continuent de compter sur les journalistes et le journalisme pour obtenir des nouvelles exactes et en temps opportun. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations professionnelles et respectueuses avec les journalistes afin que les Canadiens soient bien informés et disposent des informations dont ils ont besoin pour assurer leur sécurité et celle de leur famille.

Tout au long de la pandémie, les Canadiens et leurs gouvernements se sont adaptés à de nouvelles réalités. Les gouvernements doivent s’inspirer des leçons tirées de la pandémie pour s’adapter davantage et proposer des moyens plus flexibles et efficaces de servir les Canadiens. À cette fin, je m’attends à ce que tous les ministres se penchent sur des moyens d’actualiser nos façons de faire afin que le gouvernement puisse continuer de relever les défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain.

Pour assurer le succès de la présente législature, il faudra que les parlementaires, tant à la Chambre des communes qu’au Sénat, travaillent ensemble, tous partis confondus, dans le but de réaliser de grandes choses pour les Canadiens. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations constructives avec les porte-paroles de l’opposition, et à ce que vous coordonniez toute mesure législative avec le leader du gouvernement à la Chambre des communes. Dans votre rôle de ministre, vous êtes responsable devant le Parlement à la fois individuellement, de votre style de leadership et de l’accomplissement de vos responsabilités, et collectivement, à l’appui du Conseil des ministres et des décisions prises par le Cabinet. Le document Pour un gouvernement ouvert et responsable énonce ces principes fondamentaux et les normes de conduite que votre cabinet et vous devez respecter. Je m’attends à ce que vous vous familiarisiez avec ce document, qui décrit mes attentes à l’égard de chaque membre du Conseil des ministres.

Les engagements pris dans notre programme électoral sont ambitieux. L’achèvement de la lutte contre la pandémie doit demeurer au centre de nos préoccupations; toutefois, nous devons continuer de bâtir une classe moyenne forte et un avenir meilleur où chacun a une chance réelle et équitable de réussir et où personne n’est laissé pour compte.

En tant que ministre de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social, votre priorité immédiate est de mettre en place un système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants qui permettra de réduire les frais exigés des parents, de créer plus de places de qualité, de recruter et de retenir des éducateurs qualifiés ainsi que de faire en sorte que tous les enfants bénéficient du meilleur départ possible dans la vie. Parallèlement, vous travaillerez avec des partenaires autochtones pour mettre en place un système d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants adapté à la culture autochtone. Par ailleurs, vous vous concentrerez sur la mise en œuvre du Fonds de relance des services communautaires afin d’aider les organismes de bienfaisance et les organismes sans but lucratif à s’adapter et à se moderniser, et vous veillerez à ce que Service Canada fournisse des services fiables et accessibles aux Canadiens, peu importe où ils vivent.

Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.

Avec l’appui de la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse, continuer à promouvoir la création et la durabilité d’un système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants, en prenant les mesures suivantes :
Conclure les négociations avec les provinces et territoires restants, et mettre en œuvre des ententes :
Réduire de moitié en moyenne les frais des services de garde d’enfants réglementés d’ici la fin de 2022 partout au Canada à l’extérieur du Québec;
Abaisser à 10 $ par jour en moyenne les frais de services de garde d’enfants réglementés d’ici la fin de l’exercice 2025-2026 partout au Canada à l’extérieur du Québec;
Créer 250 000 places en garderie de haute qualité et embaucher 40 000 éducateurs et éducatrices de la petite enfance d’ici la fin de l’exercice 2025-2026;
Présenter un projet de loi sur la garde d’enfants pour renforcer et protéger le système pancanadien de garde des jeunes enfants;
Créer un Conseil consultatif national sur l’apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants;
Poursuivre le travail avec les provinces et territoires visant à réduire les frais des familles pour la garde d’enfants avant et après l’école;
S’assurer que le Secrétariat fédéral sur l’apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants dispose de toutes les ressources nécessaires et est pleinement fonctionnel d’ici le début de 2023.
Travailler avec les partenaires autochtones pour s’assurer que les jeunes enfants autochtones ont accès à un système d’apprentissage et de garde autochtone culturellement approprié qui répond aux besoins des familles autochtones peu importe où elles vivent, ce qui comprend veiller à ce qu’un plus grand nombre de familles autochtones aient accès à des programmes de grande qualité, créer 3 300 places en garderie et continuer à soutenir les services de garde avant et après l'école pour les enfants des Premières Nations dans les réserves.
Faire avancer la mise en œuvre du Fonds de relance des services communautaires pour aider les organismes de bienfaisance et à but non lucratif à s’adapter et à se moderniser au moment où ils se remettent de la pandémie.
Poursuivre la mise en place de la Stratégie d’innovation sociale et de finance sociale, y compris mettre pleinement en œuvre le Fonds de finance sociale et lancer le Conseil consultatif sur l’innovation sociale.
Grâce au déploiement de la Stratégie de réduction de la pauvreté du Canada et d’autres mesures, continuer de montrer la voie à suivre en ce qui touche la mise en œuvre du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030 adopté par les Nations Unies.
Travailler avec la ministre de l’Agriculture et de l’Agroalimentaire et avec les provinces, les territoires, les municipalités, les partenaires autochtones et les intervenants à l’élaboration d’une politique nationale en matière d’alimentation dans les écoles et d’un programme national de repas nutritifs.
Travailler avec la ministre des Aînés pour fournir aux aînés un point d’accès unique à un vaste éventail de services et de prestations du gouvernement.
En tant que ministre responsable de Service Canada, vous dirigerez l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre de services et systèmes de versement des prestations modernes, sûrs et fiables pour les Canadiens et verrez à ce que tous les Canadiens admissibles y aient accès, peu importe où ils vivent.
Travailler avec la ministre du Revenu national à la mise en œuvre d’un système de paie électronique en temps réel, et veiller à ce que les entreprises de toutes tailles en bénéficient.
Augmenter la capacité et l’efficacité des organismes dirigés par des Noirs et au service des Noirs par une mise en œuvre continue de l’initiative Appuyer les communautés noires du Canada. Pour mener à bien cet engagement, vous aurez l’appui du ministre du Logement et de la Diversité et de l’Inclusion.
Travailler avec la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse pour s’assurer que la voix et les besoins des enfants soient pris en compte dans le programme de notre gouvernement au moment où il s’emploie à faire du Canada le meilleur endroit où grandir.
Travailler avec la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse et la ministre de la Santé mentale et des Dépendances et ministre associée de la Santé afin de veiller à ce que les enfants et les jeunes aient accès à des services de santé mentale pendant qu'ils se remettent des effets de la pandémie.
En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.

Pour que les Canadiens obtiennent les meilleurs résultats possible, les ministres doivent faire preuve de rigueur et coordonner leurs efforts de mise en œuvre. Je vous prie donc de m’indiquer la démarche que vous entendez suivre pour réaliser les engagements liés à votre mandat, ainsi que les priorités que vous comptez mettre en œuvre dans les plus brefs délais. De plus, pour que nous soyons responsables de notre travail, je vous demanderai de me communiquer publiquement, ainsi qu’à tous les Canadiens, les progrès accomplis dans la réalisation de ces engagements, et ce, de façon périodique.

Comme on nous l’a rappelé tout au long de la pandémie, il est non seulement souhaitable mais aussi impératif que le gouvernement s’adapte au changement. Alors que vous vous emploierez à concrétiser nos engagements, je m’attends à ce que vous preniez activement en considération les nouvelles idées et questions qui se font jour, que ce soit à la lumière de consultations menées auprès de la population, de votre travail avec les parlementaires ou de conseils formulés par la fonction publique. Je m’attends également à ce que vous travailliez avec votre sous-ministre pour réévaluer sans cesse les priorités à mesure que nous bâtissons un avenir meilleur pour tous les Canadiens. En plus de l’atteinte des résultats, vous êtes responsable de superviser le travail de votre ministère et de veiller au bon fonctionnement de votre portefeuille.

Je vous demande de respecter les principes de l’équité, de la diversité et de l’inclusion lorsque vous embaucherez du personnel pour votre cabinet et mettrez en œuvre des stratégies d’information et de recrutement pour les postes de direction et de membres de conseils dont les titulaires sont nommés par le gouvernement fédéral. Nous contribuerons ainsi à faire en sorte que les milieux de travail au gouvernement fédéral soient dynamiques et représentatifs de la population que nous servons. Vous devez également veiller à ce que votre cabinet et votre portefeuille ministériel tiennent compte de notre engagement relativement à des milieux de travail sains et sécuritaires.

Les Canadiens veulent que nous travaillions fort, que nous parlions avec franchise et que nous ayons à cœur de promouvoir leurs intérêts et aspirations. Lorsque nous commettrons des erreurs, et nous le ferons tous, les Canadiens s’attendent à ce que nous les reconnaissions et, surtout, à ce que nous en tirions des leçons.

Je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour vous acquitter des importantes responsabilités qui vous sont confiées. Sachez que vous pouvez me consulter ainsi que la vice-première ministre, dès maintenant et souvent, pour que nous puissions vous soutenir dans votre rôle de ministre.

Je vous prie d’agréer, Madame la Ministre, l’expression de ma considération respectueuse.

Le très hon. Justin Trudeau, c.p., député
Premier ministre du Canada

Depuis le début de la pandémie, les Canadiens ont dû faire face à un défi qui ne se produit qu’une fois par siècle. Malgré tout, les gens ont su se montrer à la hauteur, et ce, d’un océan à l’autre. Lorsque cela comptait le plus, les Canadiens se sont adaptés, se sont entraidés et ont fait preuve de compassion, de courage et de détermination, autant de valeurs qui nous sont chères. C’est ce qui a défini jusqu’à présent notre parcours dans cette pandémie. Et c’est ce qui nous permettra d’aller de l’avant.

En cette période difficile, les Canadiens se sont prononcés de façon démocratique. Ils nous ont confié le soin de terminer la lutte contre la COVID-19 et de soutenir le rétablissement d’une classe moyenne forte. Ils nous ont, par le fait même, donné une orientation claire : prendre des mesures audacieuses et concrètes afin de bâtir un avenir où la santé et la résilience prévaudront. C’est ce que les Canadiens nous ont demandé, et c’est exactement ce que notre gouvernement est prêt à faire. Nous nous emploierons à bâtir cet avenir meilleur en continuant de miser sur la collaboration, la mobilisation, la science et la prise de décisions fondées sur des données probantes. En nous appliquant sans relâche à obtenir des résultats, nous travaillerons de manière constructive avec les parlementaires et maintiendrons nos solides partenariats avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, les administrations municipales et nos partenaires autochtones. Le début de cette nouvelle décennie a été extrêmement difficile, mais le moment est venu de rebâtir un pays plus résilient, plus inclusif et plus fort pour tous.

La science est claire. Les Canadiens ont été clairs. Nous devons non seulement continuer d’agir concrètement à l’égard des changements climatiques, mais aussi le faire plus vite et aller plus loin à ce chapitre. Comme les Canadiens le constatent de plus en plus partout dans le pays, les changements climatiques constituent une menace existentielle. Afin de bâtir un avenir plus propre et plus vert, il nous faudra tous faire des efforts soutenus et concertés. Je m’attends à ce que vous cherchiez au sein de votre portefeuille, en votre qualité de ministre, des façons de soutenir nos efforts pangouvernementaux visant à réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, à créer des emplois propres et à relever les défis liés au climat avec lesquels les collectivités composent déjà.

Cette année, les Canadiens ont été horrifiés par la découverte de sépultures non identifiées près d’anciens pensionnats autochtones. Ces découvertes nous rappellent la nécessité d’accélérer la réconciliation avec les Premières Nations, les Inuits et les Métis. Nous savons que cette réconciliation ne peut se faire sans l’obtention de la vérité, et le gouvernement continuera d’investir dans la quête de cette vérité. À titre de ministres, nous avons le devoir de faire progresser les travaux à cet égard, tant collectivement qu’individuellement. Par conséquent, je demande à chaque ministre de mettre en œuvre la Déclaration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones et de travailler en partenariat avec les Autochtones pour faire mieux reconnaître leurs droits.

Nous devons continuer de nous attaquer aux inégalités et aux disparités systémiques profondes qui demeurent présentes dans notre tissu social, notamment au sein de nos institutions fondamentales. À cet égard, il faut que les Canadiens de chacune des régions du pays puissent se reconnaître dans les priorités de notre gouvernement et dans ce que nous réalisons. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez, en votre qualité de ministre, avec diverses communautés dans un souci d’inclusion et cherchiez activement à obtenir les divers points de vue des Canadiens et à les intégrer dans votre travail. Cela comprend les femmes, les Autochtones, les Canadiens noirs et racisés, les nouveaux arrivants, les groupes confessionnels, les personnes en situation de handicap et les Canadiens LGBTQ2. Bien entendu, le tout doit se faire dans le respect des deux langues officielles.

Dans tous les aspects de notre travail, nous continuerons de nous assurer que les politiques publiques sont élaborées dans une perspective intersectionnelle, notamment par l’application de l’analyse comparative entre les sexes plus (ACS Plus) et des indicateurs de qualité de vie dans la prise de décisions.

Les Canadiens continuent de compter sur les journalistes et le journalisme pour obtenir des nouvelles exactes et en temps opportun. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations professionnelles et respectueuses avec les journalistes afin que les Canadiens soient bien informés et disposent des informations dont ils ont besoin pour assurer leur sécurité et celle de leur famille.

Tout au long de la pandémie, les Canadiens et leurs gouvernements se sont adaptés à de nouvelles réalités. Les gouvernements doivent s’inspirer des leçons tirées de la pandémie pour s’adapter davantage et proposer des moyens plus flexibles et efficaces de servir les Canadiens. À cette fin, je m’attends à ce que tous les ministres se penchent sur des moyens d’actualiser nos façons de faire afin que le gouvernement puisse continuer de relever les défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain.

Pour assurer le succès de la présente législature, il faudra que les parlementaires, tant à la Chambre des communes qu’au Sénat, travaillent ensemble, tous partis confondus, dans le but de réaliser de grandes choses pour les Canadiens. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations constructives avec les porte-paroles de l’opposition, et à ce que vous coordonniez toute mesure législative avec le leader du gouvernement à la Chambre des communes. Dans votre rôle de ministre, vous êtes responsable devant le Parlement à la fois individuellement, de votre style de leadership et de l’accomplissement de vos responsabilités, et collectivement, à l’appui du Conseil des ministres et des décisions prises par le Cabinet. Le document Pour un gouvernement ouvert et responsable énonce ces principes fondamentaux et les normes de conduite que votre cabinet et vous devez respecter. Je m’attends à ce que vous vous familiarisiez avec ce document, qui décrit mes attentes à l’égard de chaque membre du Conseil des ministres.

Les engagements pris dans notre programme électoral sont ambitieux. L’achèvement de la lutte contre la pandémie doit demeurer au centre de nos préoccupations; toutefois, nous devons continuer de bâtir une classe moyenne forte et un avenir meilleur où chacun a une chance réelle et équitable de réussir et où personne n’est laissé pour compte.

En tant que ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, votre priorité immédiate est de soutenir les travailleurs dont le travail a été interrompu par des mesures de santé publique. Je m’attends à ce que vous mettiez en place un meilleur système d’assurance-emploi qui soit plus inclusif, à ce que vous meniez à bien et fassiez progresser les premières mesures importantes prévues dans le Plan d’action pour l’inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, et à ce que vous aidiez les travailleurs et les collectivités à prospérer au moment où nous passons à la carboneutralité, notamment par le lancement d’un centre de formation pour les emplois propres.

Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.

Travailler à l’adoption et à la mise en œuvre d’une nouvelle Prestation canadienne pour les travailleurs en cas de confinement pour soutenir les travailleurs touchés par une interruption de travail découlant des mesures de santé publique.
Travailler avec le ministre de la Santé, les provinces et les territoires afin de faire former jusqu’à 50 000 nouveaux préposés aux services de soutien à la personne.

En plus de prévoir le prolongement des prestations de maladie (de 15 à 26 semaines), le plan comprend :
une nouvelle prestation d’assurance-emploi pour les travailleurs autonomes canadiens, qui fournirait un soutien en cas de chômage comparable à celui qu’offre l’assurance-emploi pouvant s’étendre sur 26 semaines;
une nouvelle prestation de 15 semaines pour les parents adoptifs;
une nouvelle prestation d’assurance-carrière pour offrir aux travailleurs de longue date qui ont perdu leur emploi un revenu d’emploi additionnel pendant qu’ils tentent de réintégrer le marché du travail;
la prise en compte des réalités des artistes et des travailleurs du secteur de la culture.
Finaliser et rendre public le Plan d’action pour l’inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, en consultation avec la communauté des personnes en situation de handicap. Ce Plan comprend des mesures immédiates dans des secteurs importants comme la sécurité financière et l’emploi et prévoit la création d’espaces inclusifs pour les personnes en situation de handicap et l’adoption d’une approche moderne et d’une définition commune à l’égard de l’invalidité dans l’ensemble du gouvernement du Canada. En plus des mesures qui seront instaurées par d’autres ministres, les mesures à prendre comprennent les suivantes :
Mettre en œuvre une stratégie d’emploi pour les Canadiens en situation de handicap;
Entreprendre un examen complet de l’accès aux programmes d’invalidité fédéraux, notamment pour les personnes ayant des problèmes de santé mentale;
Soutenir les organisations nationales de personnes en situation de handicap afin de renforcer leurs capacités et contribuer aux efforts visant à éliminer les obstacles systémiques;

Éliminer définitivement les intérêts sur les prêts d’études canadiens et les prêts canadiens aux apprentis. Faire passer à 50 000 $ le seuil du Programme d’aide au remboursement pour les étudiants emprunteurs qui sont célibataires et apporter les modifications appropriées aux seuils pour les familles de diverses tailles. Et permettre aux nouveaux parents de suspendre le remboursement de leurs prêts étudiants jusqu’à ce que leur plus jeune enfant ait cinq ans.
Faire passer à 50 % l’effacement maximal de la dette auquel les médecins de famille, les résidents en médecine familiale, les infirmiers praticiens ou les infirmiers travaillant en régions rurales ou éloignées sont admissibles en vertu du Programme canadien de dispense de remboursement des prêts d’études. Élargir la liste actuelle des professionnels. Et entreprendre un examen pour s’assurer que les communautés rurales sont pleinement admissibles au programme afin d’améliorer l’accès aux soins de santé et aux services sociaux dans ces communautés.
Pour soutenir l’avenir et la qualité de vie des travailleurs et de leurs communautés dans le cadre de la transition vers une économie à faibles émissions de carbone :
Aider le ministre des Ressources naturelles et le ministre du Travail à favoriser l'adoption d’un projet de loi et de mesures exhaustives pour assurer une transition équitable. Ce travail s’appuiera sur les consultations menées auprès de travailleurs, de syndicats, de peuples autochtones, d’employeurs, de communautés, de provinces et de territoires;
Lancer un Centre de formation pour les emplois propres afin d’aider les travailleurs de tous les secteurs à mettre à niveau leurs compétences ou à en acquérir de nouvelles pour être à la fine pointe de l’industrie du carbone à zéro émission;

Continuer à faire la promotion du Service canadien d’apprentissage en partenariat avec les provinces, les territoires, les employeurs et les syndicats pour que les apprentis du Sceau rouge aient suffisamment d’occasions d’acquérir de l’expérience professionnelle, notamment auprès de petits et moyens employeurs, pour terminer leur formation à temps et trouver des emplois bien rémunérés.
Continuer à soutenir le travail de la campagne nationale visant à promouvoir les métiers spécialisés comme des carrières de premier choix pour les jeunes et les populations diverses.
Avec le ministre de l’Immigration, des Réfugiés et de la Citoyenneté, établir un système d’employeur de confiance pour les entreprises canadiennes embauchant des travailleurs étrangers temporaires et, dans cadre de l’amélioration du Volet des talents mondiaux du Programme des travailleurs étrangers temporaires, simplifier le renouvellement des permis, faire respecter le délai de traitement de deux semaines et créer une ligne d’assistance pour les employeurs. Continuer de travailler avec les provinces, les territoires et les organismes de réglementation pour améliorer la reconnaissance des titres de compétences étrangers.
Avec l’appui de la ministre de l’Agriculture et de l’Agroalimentaire, mettre en œuvre des permis de travail sectoriels et renforcer le régime d’inspection pour assurer la santé et la sécurité des travailleurs étrangers temporaires.

En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.

Pour que les Canadiens obtiennent les meilleurs résultats possible, les ministres doivent faire preuve de rigueur et coordonner leurs efforts de mise en œuvre. Je vous prie donc de m’indiquer la démarche que vous entendez suivre pour réaliser les engagements liés à votre mandat, ainsi que les priorités que vous comptez mettre en œuvre dans les plus brefs délais. De plus, pour que nous soyons responsables de notre travail, je vous demanderai de me communiquer publiquement, ainsi qu’à tous les Canadiens, les progrès accomplis dans la réalisation de ces engagements, et ce, de façon périodique.

Comme on nous l’a rappelé tout au long de la pandémie, il est non seulement souhaitable mais aussi impératif que le gouvernement s’adapte au changement. Alors que vous vous emploierez à concrétiser nos engagements, je m’attends à ce que vous preniez activement en considération les nouvelles idées et questions qui se font jour, que ce soit à la lumière de consultations menées auprès de la population, de votre travail avec les parlementaires ou de conseils formulés par la fonction publique. Je m’attends également à ce que vous travailliez avec votre sous-ministre pour réévaluer sans cesse les priorités à mesure que nous bâtissons un avenir meilleur pour tous les Canadiens. En plus de l’atteinte des résultats, vous êtes responsable de superviser le travail de votre ministère et de veiller au bon fonctionnement de votre portefeuille.

Je vous demande de respecter les principes de l’équité, de la diversité et de l’inclusion lorsque vous embaucherez du personnel pour votre cabinet et mettrez en œuvre des stratégies d’information et de recrutement pour les postes de direction et de membres de conseils dont les titulaires sont nommés par le gouvernement fédéral. Nous contribuerons ainsi à faire en sorte que les milieux de travail au gouvernement fédéral soient dynamiques et représentatifs de la population que nous servons. Vous devez également veiller à ce que votre cabinet et votre portefeuille ministériel tiennent compte de notre engagement relativement à des milieux de travail sains et sécuritaires.

Les Canadiens veulent que nous travaillions fort, que nous parlions avec franchise et que nous ayons à cœur de promouvoir leurs intérêts et aspirations. Lorsque nous commettrons des erreurs, et nous le ferons tous, les Canadiens s’attendent à ce que nous les reconnaissions et, surtout, à ce que nous en tirions des leçons.

Je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour vous acquitter des importantes responsabilités qui vous sont confiées. Sachez que vous pouvez me consulter ainsi que la vice-première ministre, dès maintenant et souvent, pour que nous puissions vous soutenir dans votre rôle de ministre.

Je vous prie d’agréer, Madame la Ministre, l’expression de ma considération respectueuse.

En tant que ministre des Aînés, votre priorité immédiate est de soutenir et de faire progresser l’engagement pris par le gouvernement d’augmenter la Sécurité de la vieillesse et le Supplément de revenu garanti. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez le ministre de la Santé à améliorer la qualité et la disponibilité des soins de longue durée, et à prendre des mesures concrètes pour soutenir les aînés qui veulent vieillir chez eux. De plus, vous continuerez de créer des possibilités pour les aînés d’entretenir plus de liens, d’obtenir du soutien et d’être des membres actifs de leur communauté en mettant en œuvre le programme Nouveaux Horizons pour les aînés.

Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.

En tablant sur notre engagement à l’égard de la Sécurité de la vieillesse, augmenter le Supplément de revenu garanti de 500 $ pour les aînés vivant seuls et de 750 $ pour les couples, à compter de l’âge de 65 ans.
Veiller à ce que la Prestation canadienne d’urgence (PCU) et la Prestation canadienne de la relance économique (PCRE) n’aient pas d’incidence négative sur l’admissibilité des aînés au Supplément de revenu garanti.
Avec l’appui du ministre de la Santé, créer un comité d’experts chargé de formuler des recommandations sur la mise en œuvre d’une allocation Vieillir chez soi.
Aider les organismes communautaires à fournir un soutien pratique pour aider les aînés à faibles revenus ou autrement vulnérables à vivre chez eux aussi longtemps que possible, et appuyer les projets régionaux et nationaux qui facilitent l’expansion de services ayant déjà fait leurs preuves pour ce qui est d’aider les aînés à demeurer dans leur domicile.
Travailler avec la ministre de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social pour fournir aux aînés un point d’accès unique à un vaste éventail de services et de prestations du gouvernement.
Continuer de collaborer avec le ministre de la Justice et procureur général du Canada pour renforcer l’approche du Canada à l’égard de la maltraitance des personnes âgées en mettant la dernière main à la définition nationale des mauvais traitements infligés aux aînés, en investissant des fonds pour améliorer la collecte de données, et en établissant dans le Code criminel de nouvelles infractions et de nouvelles sanctions liées à la maltraitance des aînés.
Représenter le gouvernement du Canada au Forum des ministres fédéral, provinciaux et territoriaux responsables des aînés.
Continuer de diriger les travaux d’Emploi et Développement social Canada portant sur les programmes destinés aux aînés, ce qui comprend le programme Nouveaux Horizons pour les aînés.
Aider le ministre de la Santé à améliorer la qualité et la disponibilité des établissements et des lits de soins de longue durée. Pour ce faire, travailler avec les provinces et territoires pour améliorer les mesures de prévention et de contrôle des infections, définir les principes communs et élaborer des normes nationales afin que les aînés reçoivent les soins qu’ils méritent.

Monsieur le Ministre,

Je vous remercie d’avoir accepté de servir les Canadiens en tant que ministre du Travail.

Depuis le début de la pandémie, les Canadiens ont dû faire face à un défi qui ne se produit qu’une fois par siècle. Malgré tout, les gens ont su se montrer à la hauteur, et ce, d’un océan à l’autre. Lorsque cela comptait le plus, les Canadiens se sont adaptés, se sont entraidés et ont fait preuve de compassion, de courage et de détermination, autant de valeurs qui nous sont chères.

Nous devons continuer de nous attaquer aux inégalités et aux disparités systémiques profondes qui demeurent présentes dans notre tissu social, notamment au sein de nos institutions fondamentales. À cet égard, il faut que les Canadiens de chacune des régions du pays puissent se reconnaître dans les priorités de notre gouvernement et dans ce que nous réalisons. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez, en votre qualité de ministre, avec diverses communautés dans un souci d’inclusion et cherchiez activement à obtenir les divers points de vue des Canadiens et à les intégrer dans votre travail. Cela comprend les femmes, les Autochtones, les Canadiens noirs et racisés, les nouveaux arrivants, les groupes confessionnels, les personnes en situation de handicap et les Canadiens LGBTQ2. Bien entendu, le tout doit se faire dans le respect des deux langues officielles.

Dans tous les aspects de notre travail, nous continuerons de nous assurer que les politiques publiques sont élaborées dans une perspective intersectionnelle, notamment par l’application de l’analyse comparative entre les sexes plus (ACS Plus) et des indicateurs de qualité de vie dans la prise de décisions.

Les Canadiens continuent de compter sur les journalistes et le journalisme pour obtenir des nouvelles exactes et en temps opportun. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations professionnelles et respectueuses avec les journalistes afin que les Canadiens soient bien informés et disposent des informations dont ils ont besoin pour assurer leur sécurité et celle de leur famille.

Tout au long de la pandémie, les Canadiens et leurs gouvernements se sont adaptés à de nouvelles réalités. Les gouvernements doivent s’inspirer des leçons tirées de la pandémie pour s’adapter davantage et proposer des moyens plus flexibles et efficaces de servir les Canadiens. À cette fin, je m’attends à ce que tous les ministres se penchent sur des moyens d’actualiser nos façons de faire afin que le gouvernement puisse continuer de relever les défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain.

Pour assurer le succès de la présente législature, il faudra que les parlementaires, tant à la Chambre des communes qu’au Sénat, travaillent ensemble, tous partis confondus, dans le but de réaliser de grandes choses pour les Canadiens. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations constructives avec les porte-paroles de l’opposition, et à ce que vous coordonniez toute mesure législative avec le leader du gouvernement à la Chambre des communes. Dans votre rôle de ministre, vous êtes responsable devant le Parlement à la fois individuellement, de votre style de leadership et de l’accomplissement de vos responsabilités, et collectivement, à l’appui du Conseil des ministres et des décisions prises par le Cabinet. Le document Pour un gouvernement ouvert et responsable énonce ces principes fondamentaux et les normes de conduite que votre cabinet et vous devez respecter. Je m’attends à ce que vous vous familiarisiez avec ce document, qui décrit mes attentes à l’égard de chaque membre du Conseil des ministres.

Les engagements pris dans notre programme électoral sont ambitieux. L’achèvement de la lutte contre la pandémie doit demeurer au centre de nos préoccupations; toutefois, nous devons continuer de bâtir une classe moyenne forte et un avenir meilleur où chacun a une chance réelle et équitable de réussir et où personne n’est laissé pour compte.

En tant que ministre du Travail, vos priorités immédiates sont de collaborer avec les milieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale pour veiller à ce que la vaccination contre la COVID-19 y soit obligatoire, et de modifier le Code canadien du travail de sorte que tous les travailleurs régis par les lois fédérales aient droit à 10 jours de congés de maladie payés. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez avec les employeurs sous réglementation fédérale et les organisations représentant les travailleurs, ainsi qu’avec vos homologues provinciaux et territoriaux, pour rendre les lieux de travail plus sécuritaires et équitables pour toutes les personnes à l’échelle du pays et à ce que vous chapeautiez nos efforts visant à éliminer le travail forcé des chaînes d’approvisionnement canadiennes.

Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.

Poursuivre la collaboration avec les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale pour veiller à ce que la vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 soit mise en œuvre.
Obtenir l’adoption de modifications au Code canadien du travail pour accorder 10 jours de congé de maladie payés à tous les travailleurs sous réglementation fédérale, et convoquer les provinces et les territoires pour élaborer un plan d’action national dans le but de légiférer les congés de maladie dans tout le pays, tout en respectant les compétences provinciales et territoriales et les besoins uniques des propriétaires de petites entreprises.
Terminer l’élaboration d’une politique de droit de se déconnecter, de concert avec les employeurs sous réglementation fédérale et les groupes syndicaux.
Aller de l’avant et obtenir l’adoption de modifications au Code canadien du travail afin d’inclure la santé mentale en tant qu’élément particulier des normes de santé et de sécurité au travail et d’exiger des employeurs sous réglementation fédérale qu’ils prennent des mesures préventives visant à résoudre les problèmes de stress et les risques de blessures au travail.
Modifier le Code canadien du travail afin de prévoir jusqu’à cinq jours de congé payés de plus pour les employés sous réglementation fédérale qui vivent une situation de fausse couche ou de mort à la naissance, et de renforcer les dispositions visant à mieux soutenir les travailleuses qui doivent être réaffectées pendant la grossesse et l’allaitement.
Continuer à travailler avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux pour mettre pleinement en œuvre la Convention sur la violence et le harcèlement de 2019 de l’Organisation internationale du Travail et continuer à appuyer les employeurs et les syndicats pour renforcer les mesures de prévention du harcèlement et de la violence dans les lieux de travail de compétence fédérale.
Diriger les efforts pour fournir des produits d’hygiène féminine gratuits dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale afin de favoriser la participation des femmes au travail.
Avec l’appui de la présidente du Conseil du Trésor, du ministre du Logement et de la Diversité et de l’Inclusion et de la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse, travailler à accélérer l’examen de la Loi sur l’équité en matière d’emploi et assurer la mise en œuvre rapide des améliorations nécessaires.
Moderniser le Programme de contrats fédéraux pour veiller à ce que les entrepreneurs fédéraux paient à leurs employés le salaire minimum fédéral, de façon à respecter les engagements relatifs au leadership sur les plans environnemental, social et de la gouvernance et à l’approvisionnement du gouvernement.
Continuer à faire progresser la mise en œuvre de la Loi sur l’équité salariale dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale.
Créer un processus de négociation collective plus équitable dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale en faisant avancer des mesures législatives qui interdisent le recours à des travailleurs de remplacement lorsqu’un employeur syndiqué met ses employés en lock-out.
Appuyer la vice-première ministre et ministre des Finances dans l’introduction d’un crédit d’impôt pour la mobilité de la main-d’œuvre permettant aux travailleurs des secteurs du bâtiment et de la construction de déduire les frais admissibles de déplacement et de réinstallation temporaire.
Travailler avec le ministre des Ressources naturelles pour favoriser l’adoption d’un projet de loi et de mesures exhaustives pour assurer une transition équitable. Ce travail s’appuiera sur les consultations menées auprès de travailleurs, de syndicats, de peuples autochtones, d’employeurs, de communautés, de provinces et de territoires pour soutenir l’avenir et la qualité de vie des travailleurs et de leurs communautés dans le cadre de la transition vers une économie à faibles émissions de carbone. Vous recevrez l’appui de la ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap et des ministres responsables des agences de développement régional.
Travailler à des modifications qui permettront aux travailleurs à l’emploi de grandes plateformes numériques de bénéficier d’une sécurité d’emploi en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Vous collaborerez également avec la ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap pour veiller à ce que ces travailleurs bénéficient de prestations et de mesures de soutien.
Avec l’appui du ministre de la Sécurité publique, de la ministre des Services publics et de l’Approvisionnement et de la ministre du Commerce international, de la Promotion des exportations, de la Petite Entreprise et du Développement économique, présenter un projet de loi pour éliminer le travail forcé des chaînes d’approvisionnement canadiennes et faire en sorte que les entreprises canadiennes qui mènent des activités à l’étranger ne contribuent pas à des violations des droits de la personne.
En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.

Pour que les Canadiens obtiennent les meilleurs résultats possible, les ministres doivent faire preuve de rigueur et coordonner leurs efforts de mise en œuvre. Je vous prie donc de m’indiquer la démarche que vous entendez suivre pour réaliser les engagements liés à votre mandat, ainsi que les priorités que vous comptez mettre en œuvre dans les plus brefs délais. De plus, pour que nous soyons responsables de notre travail, je vous demanderai de me communiquer publiquement, ainsi qu’à tous les Canadiens, les progrès accomplis dans la réalisation de ces engagements, et ce, de façon périodique.

Comme on nous l’a rappelé tout au long de la pandémie, il est non seulement souhaitable mais aussi impératif que le gouvernement s’adapte au changement. Alors que vous vous emploierez à concrétiser nos engagements, je m’attends à ce que vous preniez activement en considération les nouvelles idées et questions qui se font jour, que ce soit à la lumière de consultations menées auprès de la population, de votre travail avec les parlementaires ou de conseils formulés par la fonction publique. Je m’attends également à ce que vous travailliez avec votre sous-ministre pour réévaluer sans cesse les priorités à mesure que nous bâtissons un avenir meilleur pour tous les Canadiens. En plus de l’atteinte des résultats, vous êtes responsable de superviser le travail de votre ministère et de veiller au bon fonctionnement de votre portefeuille.

Je vous demande de respecter les principes de l’équité, de la diversité et de l’inclusion lorsque vous embaucherez du personnel pour votre cabinet et mettrez en œuvre des stratégies d’information et de recrutement pour les postes de direction et de membres de conseils dont les titulaires sont nommés par le gouvernement fédéral. Nous contribuerons ainsi à faire en sorte que les milieux de travail au gouvernement fédéral soient dynamiques et représentatifs de la population que nous servons. Vous devez également veiller à ce que votre cabinet et votre portefeuille ministériel tiennent compte de notre engagement relativement à des milieux de travail sains et sécuritaires.

Les Canadiens veulent que nous travaillions fort, que nous parlions avec franchise et que nous ayons à cœur de promouvoir leurs intérêts et aspirations. Lorsque nous commettrons des erreurs, et nous le ferons tous, les Canadiens s’attendent à ce que nous les reconnaissions et, surtout, à ce que nous en tirions des leçons.

Je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour vous acquitter des importantes responsabilités qui vous sont confiées. Sachez que vous pouvez me consulter ainsi que la vice-première ministre, dès maintenant et souvent, pour que nous puissions vous soutenir dans votre rôle de ministre.

Je vous prie d’agréer, Monsieur le Ministre, l’expression de ma considération respectueuse.

Le très hon. Justin Trudeau, c.p., député

Dear Minister Qualtrough:

Thank you for continuing to serve Canadians as Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion.

From the beginning of this pandemic, Canadians have faced a once-in-a-century challenge. And through it all, from coast to coast to coast, people have met the moment. When it mattered most, Canadians adapted, helped one another, and stayed true to our values of compassion, courage and determination. That is what has defined our path through this pandemic so far. And that is what will pave our way forward.

During a difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice. They entrusted us to finish the fight against COVID-19 and support the recovery of a strong middle class. At the same time, they also gave us clear direction: to take bold, concrete action to build a healthier, more resilient future. That is what Canadians have asked us to do and it is exactly what our Government is ready to deliver. We will work to build that brighter future through continued collaboration, engagement, and the use of science and evidence-based decision-making. With an unwavering focus on delivering results, we will work constructively with Parliamentarians and maintain our strong partnerships with provincial, territorial and municipal governments and Indigenous partners. This decade has had an incredibly difficult start, but this is the moment to rebuild a more resilient, inclusive and stronger country for everyone.

The science is clear. Canadians have been clear. We must not only continue taking real climate action, we must also move faster and go further. As Canadians are increasingly experiencing across the country, climate change is an existential threat. Building a cleaner, greener future will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all of us. As Minister, I expect you to seek opportunities within your portfolio to support our whole-of-government effort to reduce emissions, create clean jobs and address the climate-related challenges communities are already facing.

This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites near former residential schools. These discoveries underscore that we must move faster on the path of reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth and our Government will continue to invest in that truth. As Ministers, each of us has a duty to further this work, both collectively and as individuals. Consequently, I am directing every Minister to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples to advance their rights.

We must continue to address the profound systemic inequities and disparities that remain present in the core fabric of our society, including our core institutions. To this effect, it is essential that Canadians in every region of the country see themselves reflected in our Government’s priorities and our work. As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages.

Across our work, we remain committed to ensuring that public policies are informed and developed through an intersectional lens, including applying frameworks such as Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and the quality of life indicators in decision-making.

Canadians continue to rely on journalists and journalism for accurate and timely news. I expect you to maintain professional and respectful relationships with journalists to ensure that Canadians are well informed and have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.

Throughout the course of the pandemic, Canadians and their governments have adapted to new realities. Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.

The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by Cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry.

Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind.

As Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, your immediate priority is to support workers whose work has been interrupted by public health measures. I also expect you to build a better, more inclusive employment insurance system, complete and advance early and significant actions under Canada’s Disability Inclusion Action Plan, and help workers and communities prosper as we move to net-zero, including through the launch of a Clean Jobs Training Centre.

To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.

Secure passage and ensure implementation of a new Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit to support workers whose work is interrupted due to public health measures.
Work with the Minister of Health and provinces and territories to train up to 50,000 new personal support workers.
Move forward with the design, introduction and implementation of a Canada Disability Benefit Act and Canada Disability Benefit for low-income working age persons with disabilities.
Taking into account input received through consultations on the future of Employment Insurance (EI), by Summer 2022, bring forward and begin implementing a plan to modernize the EI system for the 21st century, building a stronger and more inclusive system that covers all workers, including workers in seasonal employment and persons employed by digital platforms, ensuring the system is simpler and more responsive for workers and employers. In addition to moving forward with extending EI sickness benefits from 15 to 26 weeks, the plan will include:
A new EI benefit for self-employed Canadians that would provide unemployment assistance comparable to EI and lasting for as many as 26 weeks;
A new 15-week benefit for adoptive parents;
A new EI Career Insurance Benefit to provide long-tenured workers who have lost their job with additional income support while they reintegrate into the labour market; and
Consideration of the realities of artists and cultural workers.
Finalize and release Canada’s Disability Inclusion Action Plan, in consultation with the disability community, with early actions in key areas of financial security and employment, creating disability-inclusive spaces and adopting a modern approach to and common definition of disability across the Government of Canada. In addition to measures to be implemented by other ministers, actions will include:
Launching an employment strategy for Canadians with disabilities;
Undertaking a comprehensive review of access to federal disability programs, including for Canadians with mental health challenges;
Supporting national disability organizations to build capacity and partner in efforts to eliminate systemic barriers;
Advancing our commitment to permanently fund support services that ensure equitable access to reading and other published works for Canadians with print disabilities; and
Proceeding with the implementation of the Accessible Canada Act and the harmonization of accessibility standards across Canada.
Permanently eliminate federal interest on Canada Student Loans and Canada Apprentice Loans, increase the repayment assistance threshold to $50,000 for Canada Student Loan borrowers who are single and make appropriate adjustments to the thresholds for other family sizes, and allow new parents to pause repayment of their federal student loans until their youngest child reaches the age of five.
Increase by 50 per cent the maximum debt forgiveness for which family doctors, residents in family medicine, nurse practitioners and nurses who work in rural or remote areas are eligible under the Canada Student Loans Forgiveness program, expand the current list of eligible professionals and undertake a review to ensure that rural communities are fully eligible in order to improve access to health care and social services in rural communities.
To support the future and livelihood of workers and their communities in the transition to a low carbon economy:
Support the Minister of Natural Resources and the Minister of Labour in moving forward with legislation and comprehensive action to achieve a Just Transition, guided by consultations with workers, unions, Indigenous Peoples, employers, communities, and provinces and territories;
Launch a Clean Jobs Training Centre to help workers across sectors upgrade or gain new skills so as to be on the leading edge of the zero carbon industry;
Redesign and implement the Canada Training Benefit; and
Address gaps in training and upskilling to ensure that all Canadian workers can take advantage of sustainable battery industry opportunities.
Double the Union Training and Innovation Program to support more apprenticeship training opportunities and partnerships in the Red Seal trades across Canada, and target greater participation from more diverse populations, including women, Indigenous people, newcomers, persons with disabilities, and Black and racialized Canadians. Continue to advance the Canadian Apprenticeship Service in partnership with provinces, territories, employers and unions so that Red Seal apprentices have sufficient work experience opportunities, including with small and medium-sized employers, to finish their training on time and find well-paying jobs.
Continue to support the work of the national campaign to promote the skilled trades as first choice careers for young people and diverse populations.
With the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, establish a Trusted Employer system for Canadian companies hiring temporary foreign workers and, as part of improving the Global Talent Stream of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, simplify permit renewals, uphold the two-week processing time and establish an employer hotline. Continue to work with provinces, territories and regulatory bodies to improve foreign credential recognition.
With the support of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, implement sector-based work permits and strengthen the inspection regime to ensure the health and safety of temporary foreign workers.
Support the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food in developing a sector-specific Agricultural Labour Strategy to address persistent and chronic labour shortages in farming and food processing in the short and long term.
Make it easier for women and vulnerable groups to access training by requiring businesses supported through the Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program to include wrap-around supports.
Support the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth in the evaluation process of GBA Plus with the goal of enhancing the framing and parameters of this analytical tool, and with particular attention to the intersectional analysis of race, indigeneity, rurality, disability and sexual identity, among other characteristics.
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making. I expect you to support your colleagues in delivering their commitments, leveraging the expertise of your department and your own lived experiences.

To best achieve results for Canadians, Ministers must be rigorous and coordinated in our approach to implementation. I would therefore ask that you return to me with a proposed approach for the delivery of your mandate commitments, including priorities for early implementation. Furthermore, to ensure we are accountable for our work, I will be asking you to publicly report to me, and all Canadians, on your progress toward these commitments on a regular basis.

As we have been reminded throughout the pandemic, adapting to change is not only something government should do, it is something government must do. As you work to fulfil our commitments, I expect you to actively consider new ideas and issues as they emerge, whether through public engagement, your work with Parliamentarians or advice from the public service. I also expect you to work with your Deputy Minister to assess priorities on a continual basis as we build a better future for all Canadians. In addition to achieving results, you are responsible for overseeing the work of your department and ensuring the effective operation of your portfolio.

As you staff your office and implement outreach and recruitment strategies for federally appointed leadership positions and boards, I ask that you uphold the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion. This helps ensure that federal workplaces are dynamic and reflective of the Canadians we serve. You will also ensure your Minister’s office and portfolio are reflective of our commitment to healthy and safe workplaces.

Canadians expect us to work hard, speak truthfully and be committed to advancing their interests and aspirations. When we make mistakes – as we all will – Canadians expect us to acknowledge them, and most importantly, to learn from them.

I know I can count on you to fulfill the important responsibilities entrusted in you, and to turn to me, and the Deputy Prime Minister, early and often to support you in your role as Minister.

Sincerely,

Prime Minister of Canada signature

Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau, P.C., M.P.

As Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, your immediate priority is to build a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care system that reduces parent fees, creates more high-quality spaces, recruits and retains skilled educators, and ensures all kids get off to the best possible start. At the same time, you will work with Indigenous partners to implement a culturally appropriate Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care system. You will also focus on implementing the Community Services Recovery Fund to help charities and non-profits adapt and modernize as well as ensure Service Canada provides reliable and accessible services to Canadians, regardless of where they live. 

To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.

Supported by the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth, continue advancing the creation and sustainability of a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care system, including:
Concluding negotiations with remaining provinces and territories and implementing agreements:
Reducing fees for regulated child care by 50 per cent on average by the end of 2022 everywhere outside of Quebec,
Reducing regulated child care fees to $10 a day on average by the end of fiscal year 2025-2026 everywhere outside of Quebec, and
Building 250,000 new high-quality child care spaces and hiring 40,000 more early childhood educators by the end of fiscal year 2025-2026;
Introducing federal child care legislation to strengthen and protect a high-quality Canada-wide child care system; 
Establishing a National Advisory Council on Early Learning and Child Care;
Continuing to advance work with provinces and territories to reduce fees for families for before and after school care; and
Ensuring the Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care is fully resourced and operational by early 2023.
Work with Indigenous partners to ensure that Indigenous children have access to a culturally appropriate Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care system that meets the needs of Indigenous families wherever they live, including ensuring more Indigenous families have access to high-quality programming, creating 3,300 new child care spaces, and continuing to support before and after school care for First Nations children on reserve.
Advance the implementation of the Community Services Recovery Fund to help charities and non-profits adapt and modernize as they recover from the pandemic.
Continue advancing the Social Innovation and Social Finance strategy, including fully implementing the Social Finance Fund and launching the Social Innovation Advisory Council.
Through the delivery of Canada’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and other measures, continue leading implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations.
Work with the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and with provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous partners and stakeholders to develop a National School Food Policy and to work toward a national school nutritious meal program.
Work with the Minister of Seniors to provide seniors with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits.
As the Minister responsible for Service Canada, lead the development and implementation of modern, resilient, secure and reliable services and benefit delivery systems for Canadians and ensure those services and benefits reach all Canadians regardless of where they live.
Work with the Minister of National Revenue toward the implementation of a real-time e-payroll system, and ensure that businesses of all sizes benefit from this work.
Enhance the capacity and effectiveness of Black-led and Black-serving organizations through the continued implementation of the Supporting Black Canadian Communities Initiative. You will be supported in this work by the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion.
Work with the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth to ensure the voices and needs of children are represented in our Government’s agenda, as we work to make Canada the best place to grow up.
Work with the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth and the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions to ensure mental health supports are accessible to children and youth as they recover from the impact of the pandemic.
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making. I expect you to support your colleagues in delivering their commitments, leveraging the expertise of your department and your own lived experiences.

As we have been reminded throughout the pandemic, adapting to change is not only something government should do, it is something government must do. As you work to fulfil our commitments, I expect you to actively consider new ideas and issues as they emerge, whether through public engagement, your work with Parliamentarians or advice from the public service. I also expect you to work with your Deputy Minister to assess priorities on a continual basis as we build a better future for all Canadians. In addition to achieving results, you are responsible for overseeing the work of your department and ensuring the effective operation of your portfolio.

As you staff your office and implement outreach and recruitment strategies for federally appointed leadership positions and boards, I ask that you uphold the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion. This helps ensure that federal workplaces are dynamic and reflective of the Canadians we serve. You will also ensure your Minister’s office and portfolio are reflective of our commitment to healthy and safe workplaces.

Canadians expect us to work hard, speak truthfully and be committed to advancing their interests and aspirations. When we make mistakes – as we all will – Canadians expect us to acknowledge them, and most importantly, to learn from them.

I know I can count on you to fulfill the important responsibilities entrusted in you, and to turn to me, and the Deputy Prime Minister, early and often to support you in your role as Minister.

Sincerely,

Dear Minister O’Regan:

Thank you for agreeing to serve Canadians as Minister of Labour.

From the beginning of this pandemic, Canadians have faced a once-in-a-century challenge. And through it all, from coast to coast to coast, people have met the moment. When it mattered most, Canadians adapted, helped one another, and stayed true to our values of compassion, courage and determination. That is what has defined our path through this pandemic so far. And that is what will pave our way forward.

During a difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice. They entrusted us to finish the fight against COVID-19 and support the recovery of a strong middle class. At the same time, they also gave us clear direction: to take bold, concrete action to build a healthier, more resilient future. That is what Canadians have asked us to do and it is exactly what our Government is ready to deliver. We will work to build that brighter future through continued collaboration, engagement, and the use of science and evidence-based decision-making. With an unwavering focus on delivering results, we will work constructively with Parliamentarians and maintain our strong partnerships with provincial, territorial and municipal governments and Indigenous partners. This decade has had an incredibly difficult start, but this is the moment to rebuild a more resilient, inclusive and stronger country for everyone.

The science is clear. Canadians have been clear. We must not only continue taking real climate action, we must also move faster and go further. As Canadians are increasingly experiencing across the country, climate change is an existential threat. Building a cleaner, greener future will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all of us. As Minister, I expect you to seek opportunities within your portfolio to support our whole-of-government effort to reduce emissions, create clean jobs and address the climate-related challenges communities are already facing.

This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites near former residential schools. These discoveries underscore that we must move faster on the path of reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth and our Government will continue to invest in that truth. As Ministers, each of us has a duty to further this work, both collectively and as individuals. Consequently, I am directing every Minister to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples to advance their rights.

We must continue to address the profound systemic inequities and disparities that remain present in the core fabric of our society, including our core institutions. To this effect, it is essential that Canadians in every region of the country see themselves reflected in our Government’s priorities and our work. As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages.

Across our work, we remain committed to ensuring that public policies are informed and developed through an intersectional lens, including applying frameworks such as Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and the quality of life indicators in decision-making.

Canadians continue to rely on journalists and journalism for accurate and timely news. I expect you to maintain professional and respectful relationships with journalists to ensure that Canadians are well informed and have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.

Throughout the course of the pandemic, Canadians and their governments have adapted to new realities. Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.

The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by Cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry.

Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind.

As Minister of Labour, your immediate priorities are to work with federally regulated workplaces to ensure that COVID-19 vaccinations are enforced for those workers and to advance amendments to the Canada Labour Code to provide 10 paid days of sick leave for all federally regulated workers. I also expect you to work with federally regulated employers and labour groups, and with provincial and territorial counterparts, to make workplaces fairer and safer for everyone across the country as well as lead our efforts to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains.

To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.

Continue to work with federally regulated workplaces to ensure that COVID-19 vaccination is enforced.
Secure passage of amendments to the Canada Labour Code to provide 10 days of paid sick leave for all federally regulated workers, and convene provinces and territories to develop a national action plan to legislate sick leave across the country while respecting provincial-territorial jurisdiction and the unique needs of small business owners.
Complete the development of a right-to-disconnect policy, in consultation with federally regulated employers and labour groups.
Move forward with and secure passage of amendments to the Canada Labour Code to include mental health as a specific element of occupational health and safety and to require federally regulated employers to take preventative steps to address workplace stress and injury.
Amend the Canada Labour Code to provide up to five new paid leave days for federally regulated employees who experience a miscarriage or still birth, and to strengthen provisions to better support working women who need to be re-assigned during pregnancy and while breast-feeding.
Continue working with provincial and territorial governments to fully implement the International Labour Organization Violence and Harassment Convention, 2019, and continue to support employers and unions to strengthen harassment and violence prevention measures in federally regulated workplaces.
Lead the efforts to provide free menstrual products in federally regulated workplaces to help ensure women’s participation in work.
With the support of the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion and the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth, work to accelerate the review of the Employment Equity Act and ensure timely implementation of improvements.
Modernize the Federal Contractors Program to ensure federal contractors are paying their employees the federal minimum wage in order to fulfill commitments in respect of Environmental, Social and Governance leadership and government procurement.
Continue advancing the implementation of the Pay Equity Act across federally regulated workplaces.
Create a fairer collective bargaining process in federally regulated workplaces by advancing legislation to prohibit the use of replacement workers when a unionized employer has locked out its employees.
Support the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance to introduce a Labour Mobility Tax Credit to allow workers in the building and construction trades to expense eligible travel and temporary relocation costs.
Work with the Minister of Natural Resources in moving forward with legislation and comprehensive action to achieve a Just Transition. This work will be guided by consultations with workers, unions, Indigenous Peoples, employers, communities, and provinces and territories to support the future and livelihood of workers and their communities in the transition to a low carbon economy. You will be supported by the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion and Ministers responsible for Regional Development Agencies.
Work to advance amendments that entitle workers employed by digital platforms to job protections under the Canada Labour Code. This work will also include collaborating with the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion to ensure better benefits and supports for these workers.
With the support of the Minister of Public Safety, the Minister of Public Services and Procurement and the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, introduce legislation to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains and ensure that Canadian businesses operating abroad do not contribute to human rights abuses.
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making. I expect you to support your colleagues in delivering their commitments, leveraging the expertise of your department and your own lived experiences.

To best achieve results for Canadians, Ministers must be rigorous and coordinated in our approach to implementation. I would therefore ask that you return to me with a proposed approach for the delivery of your mandate commitments, including priorities for early implementation. Furthermore, to ensure we are accountable for our work, I will be asking you to publicly report to me, and all Canadians, on your progress toward these commitments on a regular basis.

As Minister of Seniors, your immediate priority is to support and help advance the Government’s commitment to increase Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement. I also expect you to support the Minister of Health in improving the quality and availability of long-term care and to take concrete actions to support seniors who want to age at home. As well, you will continue to create opportunities for seniors to be more connected, supported, and active members of their communities through implementing the New Horizons for Seniors Program.

To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.

Building on our commitment to old age security, increase the Guaranteed Income Supplement by $500 for single seniors and $750 for couples starting at age 65.
Ensure seniors’ eligibility for the Guaranteed Income Supplement is not negatively impacted by receipt of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB).
Establish an expert panel to provide recommendations for establishing an Aging at Home Benefit. You will be supported by the Minister of Health in this work.
Assist community-based organizations in providing practical support that helps low-income and otherwise vulnerable seniors age in place, and support regional and national projects that help expand services that have already demonstrated results in helping seniors stay in their homes.
Work with the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development to provide seniors with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits.
Continue to work with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada to strengthen Canada’s approach to elder abuse by finalizing the national definition of elder abuse, investing in better data collection and establishing new offences and penalties in the Criminal Code related to elder abuse.
Represent the Government of Canada at the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Ministers Responsible for Seniors Forum.
Continue leading work within Employment and Social Development Canada on seniors’ programming including the New Horizons for Seniors Program.
Support the Minister of Health in their work to improve the quality and availability of long-term care homes and beds. This includes working with provinces and territories to improve infection prevention and control measures, identify shared principles, and develop national standards to ensure seniors get the care they deserve.
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues.

This forms the third foundation of the Government’s approach.
Around the world, advanced economies are realizing that things should not go back to business as usual. COVID-19 has exposed the vulnerabilities in our societies.
The Government will create a resiliency agenda for the middle class and people working hard to join it.
This will include addressing the gaps in our social systems, investing in health care, and creating jobs. It will also include fighting climate change, and maintaining a commitment to fiscal sustainability and economic growth as the foundation of a strong and vibrant society.

ADDRESSING GAPS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS
Central to this is recognizing that one of the greatest tragedies of this pandemic is the lives lost in long-term care homes. Elders deserve to be safe, respected, and live in dignity.
Although long-term care falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, the federal government will take any action it can to support seniors while working alongside the provinces and territories.
The Government will work with Parliament on Criminal Code amendments to explicitly penalize those who neglect seniors under their care, putting them in danger.
The Government will also:
• Work with the provinces and territories to set new, national standards for long-term care so that seniors get the best support possible;
• And take additional action to help people stay in their homes longer.
The Government remains committed to increasing Old Age Security once a senior turns 75, and boosting the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit.
The Government will look at further targeted measures for personal support workers, who do an essential service helping the most vulnerable in our communities. Canada must better value their work and their contributions to our society.
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Canadians with disabilities, and highlighted long-standing challenges. The Government will bring forward a Disability Inclusion Plan, which will have:
• A new Canadian Disability Benefit modelled after the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors;
• A robust employment strategy for Canadians with disabilities;
• And a better process to determine eligibility for Government disability programs and benefits.
Over the last six months, it has become clearer than ever why Canadians need a resilient health care system.
The Government will ensure that everyone – including in rural and remote areas – has access to a family doctor or primary care team. COVID-19 has also shown that our system needs to be more flexible and able to reach people at home. The Government will continue to expand capacity to deliver virtual health care.
The Government will also continue to address the opioid epidemic tearing through communities, which is an ongoing and worsening public health crisis. Additionally, the Government will further increase access to mental health resources. All Canadians should have the care they need, when they need it. We will all be stronger for it.
The same goes for access to the medicine that keeps people healthy. Many Canadians who had drug plans through work lost this coverage when they were laid off because of the pandemic. So this is exactly the right moment to ramp up efforts to address that.
The Government remains committed to a national, universal pharmacare program and will accelerate steps to achieve this system including:
• Through a rare-disease strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs;
• Establishing a national formulary to keep drug prices low; 
• And working with provinces and territories willing to move forward without delay.
In addition to good health infrastructure, Canadians also need strong, safe communities to call home.
The Government has banned assault-style firearms. The Government will also continue implementing firearms policy commitments, including:
• Giving municipalities the ability to further restrict or ban handguns;
• And strengthening measures to control the flow of illegal guns into Canada.
Women’s safety must be the foundation on which all progress is built. The Government will accelerate investments in shelters and transition housing, and continue to advance with a National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence.
To keep building strong communities, over the next two years the Government will also invest in all types of infrastructure, including public transit, energy efficient retrofits, clean energy, rural broadband, and affordable housing, particularly for Indigenous Peoples and northern communities.
In the last six months, many more people have worked from home, done classes from the kitchen table, shopped online, and accessed government services remotely. So it has become more important than ever that all Canadians have access to the internet.
The Government will accelerate the connectivity timelines and ambitions of the Universal Broadband Fund to ensure that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed internet.
And to further link our communities together, the Government will work with partners to support regional routes for airlines. It is essential that Canadians have access to reliable and affordable regional air services. This is an issue of equity, of jobs, and of economic development. The Government will work to support this.
Strong communities are places where everyone has a safe, affordable home. No one should be without a place to stay during a pandemic, or for that matter, a Canadian winter.
This week, the Government invested more than $1 billion for people experiencing homelessness, including for this fall.
In 2017, the Government announced that it would reduce chronic homelessness by 50 percent. The Government has already helped more than a million people get a safe and affordable place to call home. Given the progress that has been made, and our commitment to do more, the Government is now focused on entirely eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada.
At the same time, the Government will also make substantial investments in housing for Canadians.
The Government will add to the historic National Housing Strategy announced in 2017 by increasing investments to rapid housing in the short term, and partnering with not-for-profits and co-ops in the mid- to long-term. For the middle class, the Government will also move forward with enhancements to the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, including in Canada’s largest cities, so families can afford to buy their first home.
Housing is something everyone deserves, and it’s also a key driver of the economy. Construction projects create jobs, and having a home is critical so people can contribute to their communities.
Just like everyone deserves a home, everyone deserves to be able to put nutritious food on the table.
The pandemic has made that harder for Canadians. The Government will continue to work with partners – including directly with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation partners – to address food insecurity in Canada. The Government will also strengthen local food supply chains here in Canada.
The Canadian and migrant workers who produce, harvest, and process our food – from people picking fruit to packing seafood – have done an outstanding job getting good food on people’s plates. They deserve the Government’s full support and protection.
The Government will also ensure that those in Canada’s supply managed sectors receive full and fair compensation for recent trade agreements. Farmers keep our families fed, and we will continue to help them succeed and grow.

A STRONGER WORKFORCE
This pandemic has revealed gaps in health, housing, and food supply. And it has also laid bare inequalities Canadians face in the workforce.
We have an opportunity to not just support Canadians, but grow their potential. Working with the provinces and territories, the Government will make the largest investment in Canadian history in training for workers. This will include by:
• Supporting Canadians as they build new skills in growing sectors;
• Helping workers receive education and accreditation;
• And strengthening workers’ futures, by connecting them to employers and good jobs, in order to grow and strengthen the middle class.
From researchers developing vaccines, to entrepreneurs building online stores, this pandemic has reminded us of the power of the knowledge economy, and how vital it is for our future.
Canadians are leading, and they should have government services that keep up.
The Government will make generational investments in updating outdated IT systems to modernize the way that Government serves Canadians, from the elderly to the young, from people looking for work to those living with a disability.
The Government will also work to introduce free, automatic tax filing for simple returns to ensure citizens receive the benefits they need.
Government must remain agile, and ready for what lies ahead.

TAKING ACTION ON EXTREME RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate action will be a cornerstone of our plan to support and create a millionjobs across the country.
This is where the world is going. Global consumers and investors are demanding and rewarding climate action.
Canadians have the determination and ingenuity to rise to this challenge and global market opportunity.
We can create good jobs today and a globally competitive economy not just next year, but in 2030, 2040, and beyond.
Canadians also know climate change threatens our health, way of life, and planet. They want climate action now, and that is what the Government will continue to deliver.
The Government will immediately bring forward a plan to exceed Canada’s 2030 climate goal. The Government will also legislate Canada’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.
As part of its plan, the Government will:
• Create thousands of jobs retrofitting homes and buildings, cutting energy costs for Canadian families and businesses;
• Invest in reducing the impact of climate-related disasters, like floods and wildfires, to make communities safer and more resilient;
• Help deliver more transit and active transit options;
• And make zero-emissions vehicles more affordable while investing in more charging stations across the country.
A good example of adapting to a carbon-neutral future is building zero-emissions vehicles and batteries. Canada has the resources – from nickel to copper – needed for these clean technologies. This – combined with Canadian expertise – is Canada’s competitive edge.
The Government will launch a new fund to attract investments in making zero-emissions products and cut the corporate tax rate in half for these companies to create jobs and make Canada a world leader in clean technology. The Government will ensure Canada is the most competitive jurisdiction in the world for clean technology companies.
Additionally, the Government will:
• Transform how we power our economy and communities by moving forward with the Clean Power Fund, including with projects like the Atlantic Loop that will connect surplus clean power to regions transitioning away from coal;
• And support investments in renewable energy and next-generation clean energy and technology solutions.
Canada cannot reach net zero without the know-how of the energy sector, and the innovative ideas of all Canadians, including people in places like British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador.
The Government will:
• Support manufacturing, natural resource, and energy sectors as they work to transform to meet a net zero future, creating good-paying and long-lasting jobs;
• And recognize farmers, foresters, and ranchers as key partners in the fight against climate change, supporting their efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience.
The Government will continue its policy of putting a price on pollution, while putting that money back in the pockets of Canadians. It cannot be free to pollute.
This pandemic has reminded Canadians of the importance of nature. The Government will work with municipalities as part of a new commitment to expand urban parks, so that everyone has access to green space. This will be done while protecting a quarter of Canada’s land and a quarter of Canada’s oceans in five years, and using nature-based solutions to fight climate change, including by planting two billion trees.
The Government will ban harmful single-use plastics next year and ensure more plastic is recycled. And the Government will also modernize Canada’s Environmental Protection Act.
When the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration was closed by a previous government, Canada lost an important tool to manage its waters. The Government will create a new Canada Water Agency to keep our water safe, clean, and well-managed. The Government will also identify opportunities to build more resilient water and irrigation infrastructure.
At the same time, the Government will look at continuing to grow Canada’s ocean economy to create opportunities for fishers and coastal communities, while advancing reconciliation and conservation objectives. Investing in the Blue Economy will help Canada prosper.

"id-ef9a965abc7f46d099cac14fffc40925","Goal","Helping Canadians Through The Pandemic","The medical and scientific fight against this virus is crucial. And so are the livelihoods of every single Canadian, worker, and family.
So the second foundation of the Government’s approach is supporting Canadians through this crisis.
The economic impact of COVID-19 on Canadians has already been worse than the 2008 financial crisis. These consequences will not be short-lived.
This is not the time for austerity. Canada entered this crisis in the best fiscal position of its peers. And the Government is using that fiscal firepower, on things like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, so that Canadians, businesses, and our entire economy have the support needed to weather the storm.
Canadians should not have to choose between health and their job, just like Canadians should not have to take on debt that their government can better shoulder.

CREATING JOBS
People losing their jobs is perhaps the clearest consequence of the global economic shock that Canadians – like those in other countries – have faced.
The CERB helped people stay healthy at home while being able to keep food on the table.
The CEWS helped people keep their jobs, or be rehired if they had been laid off.
But there is still more to be done.
Unemployment is in the double digits, and underemployment is high.
Women, racialized Canadians, and young people have borne the brunt of job losses.
Canadians need good jobs they can rely on.
To help make that happen, the Government will launch a campaign to create over one million jobs, restoring employment to previous levels. This will be done by using a range of tools, including direct investments in the social sector and infrastructure, immediate training to quickly skill up workers, and incentives for employers to hire and retain workers.
One way the Government will create these jobs is by extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy right through to next summer. The Government will work with businesses and labour to ensure the program meets the needs of the health and economic situation as it evolves.
Another example of how the Government will create jobs is by significantly scaling up the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, to provide more paid work experiences next year for young Canadians.
Now, more than ever, Canadians must work together – including by eliminating remaining barriers between provinces to full, free internal trade – to get the economy back up and running and Canadians back to work.

SUPPORTING WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
With the job losses that Canadians have faced, it became clear early on that many people would need help until they could find work once again. But existing income support systems were not designed to handle this unprecedented situation. That’s why the Government moved quickly to create the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as a temporary program to help millions of Canadians get through a very difficult time.
With the economic restart now well underway, CERB recipients should instead be supported by the Employment Insurance system. For people who would not traditionally qualify for EI, the Government will create the transitional Canada Recovery Benefit.
Over the coming months, the EI system will become the sole delivery mechanism for employment benefits, including for Canadians who did not qualify for EI before the pandemic. This pandemic has shown that Canada needs an EI system for the 21st century, including for the self-employed and those in the gig economy. 

WOMEN IN THE ECONOMY
Women – and in particular low-income women – have been hit hardest by COVID-19. This crisis has been described as a She-cession.
Many women have bravely served on the frontlines of this crisis, in our communities or by shouldering the burden of unpaid care work at home.
We must not let the legacy of the pandemic be one of rolling back the clock on women’s participation in the workforce, nor one of backtracking on the social and political gains women and allies have fought so hard to secure.
The Government will create an Action Plan for Women in the Economy to help more women get back into the workforce and to ensure a feminist, intersectional response to this pandemic and recovery. This Plan will be guided by a task force of experts whose diverse voices will power a whole of government approach.
It has been nearly 50 years since the Royal Commission on the Status of Women outlined the necessity of child care services for women’s social and economic equality. We have long understood that Canada cannot succeed if half of the population is held back. Canadians need more accessible, affordable, inclusive, and high quality childcare.
Recognizing the urgency of this challenge, the Government will make a significant, long-term, sustained investment to create a Canada-wide early learning and childcare system.
The Government will build on previous investments, learn from the model that already exists in Quebec, and work with all provinces and territories to ensure that high-quality care is accessible to all.
There is broad consensus from all parts of society, including business and labour leaders, that the time is now.
The Government also remains committed to subsidizing before- and after-school program costs. With the way that this pandemic has affected parents and families, flexible care options for primary school children are more important than ever.
The Government will also accelerate the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, which has already helped women across Canada grow their businesses.

SUPPORTING BUSINESSES
As the Government invests in people, it will continue to support job-creating businesses.
Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities and the backbone of the economy. The Government introduced a range of supports for Canadian businesses, from help with payroll through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to assistance with expenses through interest-free loans.
COVID-19 has caused businesses across the country, both large and small, to rethink their approaches. Entrepreneurs and owners are looking at more digital options, more creative solutions, and more climate-friendly investments.
The Government will help businesses adapt for the future and thrive.
This fall, in addition to extending the wage subsidy, the Government will take further steps to bridge vulnerable businesses to the other side of the pandemic by:
• Expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account to help businesseswith fixed costs;
• Improving the Business Credit Availability Program;
• And introducing further support for industries that have been the hardest hit, including travel and tourism, hospitality, and cultural industries like the performing arts.

FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
This COVID-19 emergency has had huge costs. But Canada would have had a deeper recession and a bigger long-term deficit if the Government had done less.
With interest rates so low, central banks can only do so much to help. There is a global consensus that governments must do more. Government can do so while also locking in the low cost of borrowing for decades to come. This Government will preserve Canada’s fiscal advantage and continue to be guided by values of sustainability and prudence.
There are two distinct needs. The first is to help Canadians in the short term, to do whatever it takes, using whatever fiscal firepower is needed to support people and businesses during the pandemic. The best way to keep the economy strong is to keep Canadians healthy.
The second need is to build back better, with a sustainable approach for future generations. As the Government builds a plan for stimulus and recovery, this must be done responsibly.
In the longer term, the Government will focus on targeted investments to strengthen the middle class, build resiliency, and generate growth. The Government will also identify additional ways to tax extreme wealth inequality, including by concluding work to limit the stock option deduction for wealthy individuals at large, established corporations, and addressing corporate tax avoidance by digital giants.
Web giants are taking Canadians’ money while imposing their own priorities. Things must change, and will change. The Government will act to ensure their revenue is shared more fairly with our creators and media, and will also require them to contribute to the creation, production, and distribution of our stories, on screen, in lyrics, in music, and in writing.
This fall, the Government will release an update to Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. This will outline the Government’s economic and fiscal position, provide fiscal projections, and set out new measures to implement this Throne Speech.
This update will make clear that the strength of the middle class, and the wellbeing of all Canadians, remain Canada’s key measures of success.

"id-64dc6befe30f452f95795a6dcbb4110b","Goal","Protecting Canadians From COVID-19","The first foundation of the Government’s approach is protecting Canadians from COVID-19.
This is priority number one.
It is the job of the federal government to look out for all Canadians and especially our most vulnerable. We need to work together. Beating this virus is a Team Canada effort.
Over the last six months, Canadians have stood united and strong. Their actions embody what has always been the purpose of the federal government: bringing Canadians together to achieve common goals.
Personal protective equipment has been shipped across the country. Members of the Canadian Forces were there in long-term care homes. Close to 9 million Canadians were helped with the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and over 3.5 million jobs were supported by the wage subsidy.
The Government will continue to have people’s backs just like Canadians have each other’s backs.
Through the first wave, contact tracing and testing ramped up across the country. The surge this fall further reinforces what we already know – that we must do even more.
The federal government will be there to help the provinces increase their testing capacity. Canadians should not be waiting in line for hours to get a test.
At the same time, the Government is pursuing every technology and every option for faster tests for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. As soon as tests are approved for safe use in Canada, the Government will do everything it can to see them deployed. The Government will also create a federal Testing Assistance Response Team to quickly meet surge testing needs, including in remote and isolated communities.
Local public health authorities are the backbone of our nation’s efforts to stop outbreaks before they start. As members of the communities they protect, they know the devastating economic impact a lockdown order can have.
To prevent small clusters from becoming major outbreaks, communities may need to enact short-term closure orders. To make that decision easier for the public health authorities, and to help ease the impact that science- and evidence-based decisions can have on local businesses in the short term, the Government will work to target additional financial support directly to businesses which have to temporarily shut down as a result of a local public health decision.
This will ensure that decisions are made with the health of Canadians as the first priority.
The Government will also continue to work on what communities need more broadly.
The Government has already invested over $19 billion for a Safe Restart Agreement with provinces and territories, to support everything from the capacity of health care systems to securing PPE.
To address the challenges faced by provinces and territories as they reopen classrooms, the federal government invested $2 billion in the Safe Return to Class Fund, along with new funding for First Nations communities. This is money to keep kids – and staff – safe in the classroom, whether that’s by helping schools buy cleaning supplies or upgrade ventilation.
These commitments build on federal investments to support people who are most at risk and those who care for them, including with the federal wage top-up for personal support workers. People on the frontlines who have been looking after seniors do vital work and the Government will continue to have their backs.
At the same time, the Government will continue to support Canadians as they take action to keep each other safe.
Already, people are doing their part by wearing masks. That’s important, and we can build on that commitment. Working with private sector partners, the federal government created the COVID Alert app. Canadians living in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan now have an extra tool to keep themselves and others safe. The Government hopes all the others will sign on so that people in all parts of the country can both do their part and be better protected.
The Government will also continue to work on getting Canadians the PPE they need.
This spring, the Government issued a call, and thousands of Canadian businesses and manufacturers responded. From shop floors to companies big and small, Canada’s dynamic businesses met the challenge as their workers stepped up. 
And in less than six months, Canadians are now manufacturing almost all types of PPE. The Government will continue building that domestic capacity, while securing supply chains to keep Canadians safe and create jobs.
Canadians are pulling together, whether that’s with PPE manufacturing, through the COVID Alert app, or by wearing a mask. In the same way, Canadian researchers and scientists are pitching in to the Team Canada effort with their knowledge and expertise.

VACCINE EFFORTS
In the long run, the best way to end this pandemic is with a safe and effective vaccine.
Canada’s vaccine strategy is all about ensuring that Canadians will be able to get a vaccine once it is ready.
There are many types of potential candidates. Canada is exploring the full range of options. The Government has already secured access to vaccine candidates and therapeutics, while investing in manufacturing here at home. And to get the vaccines out to Canadians once they’re ready, the Government has made further investments in our capacity for vaccine distribution.
From the Vaccine Task Force that provides the best advice on vaccine purchasing and roll-out, to the Immunity Task Force looking at how COVID-19 is affecting vulnerable populations, Canada’s top scientific minds are guiding the Government every step of the way.",""

The fourth and final foundation of the Government’s approach is defending Canadian values and ensuring they are lived experiences for everyone.
Canada is a place where we take care of each other. This has helped Canada weather the pandemic better than many other countries.
Canada must continue to stand up for the values that define this country, whether that’s welcoming newcomers, celebrating with pride the contributions of LGBTQ2 communities, or embracing two official languages. There is work still to be done, including on the road of reconciliation, and in addressing systemic racism.

RECONCILIATION
Throughout the pandemic, the Government has made it a priority to support Indigenous communities, which has helped contain the spread of COVID-19 and kept people safe. That is something the Government will continue to do.
The Government will walk the shared path of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and remain focused on implementing the commitments made in 2019.
However, the pandemic has shown that we need to keep moving forward even faster on a number of fronts including by:
• Expediting work to co-develop distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation, and a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy;
• Accelerating work on the National Action Plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls’ Calls for Justice, as well as implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action;
• And continuing to close the infrastructure gap in Indigenous communities, working on a distinctions-basis with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation to accelerate the government’s 10-year commitment.
The Government will also:
• Make additional resiliency investments to meet the clean drinking water commitment in First Nations communities;
• And support additional capacity-building for First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation.
The Government will move forward to introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples before the end of this year.

ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM
For too many Canadians, systemic racism is a lived reality. We know that racism did not take a pause during the pandemic. On the contrary, COVID-19 has hit racialized Canadians especially hard.
Many people – especially Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians – have raised their voices and stood up to demand change.
They are telling us we must do more. The Government agrees.
The Government pledged to address systemic racism, and committed to do so in a way informed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and Indigenous Peoples.
The Government has invested in economic empowerment through the Black Entrepreneurship Program, while working to close the gaps in services for Indigenous communities. Important steps were taken with the release of Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy for 2019-2022, the creation of an anti-racism secretariat, and the appointment of the first-ever Minister focused specifically on diversity and inclusion. This is all good, but much more needs to be done for permanent, transformative change to take shape.
The Government will redouble its efforts by:
• Taking action on online hate;
• Going further on economic empowerment for specific communities, and increasing diversity on procurement;
• Building a whole-of-federal-government approach around better collection of disaggregated data;
• Implementing an action plan to increase representation in hiring and appointments, and leadership development within the Public Service;
• And taking new steps to support the artistic and economic contributions of Black Canadian culture and heritage.
Progress must also be made throughout the policing and justice systems. All Canadians must have the confidence that the justice system is there to protect them, not to harm them. Black Canadians and Indigenous Peoples are
overrepresented in the criminal justice system. That has to change.
The Government will take steps to ensure that the strong hand of criminal justice is used where it is needed to keep people safe, but not where it would be discriminatory or counterproductive.
The Government will:
• Introduce legislation and make investments that take action to address the systemic inequities in all phases of the criminal justice system, from diversion to sentencing, from rehabilitation to records;
• Move forward on enhanced civilian oversight of our law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP;
• Modernize training for police and law enforcement, including addressing standards around the use of force;
• Move forward on RCMP reforms, with a shift toward community-led policing;
• And accelerate work to co-develop a legislative framework for First Nations policing as an essential service.

PROTECTING TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES
Our two official languages are woven into the fabric of our country.
The defence of the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, and the defence of the rights of the Anglophone minority within Quebec, is a priority for the Government.
The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique. There are almost 8 million Francophones in Canada within a region of over 360 million inhabitants who are almost exclusively Anglophone. The Government therefore has the responsibility to protect and promote French not only outside of Quebec, but also within Quebec.
In this vein, 51 years after the passage of the Official Languages Act, the Government is committed to strengthening this legislation among other things, taking into consideration the unique reality of French.

A WELCOMING CANADA
Immigration remains a driver of Canada’s economic growth.
With other countries rejecting global talent that could help their economy, Canada has an opportunity as we recover to become the world’s top destination for talent, capital, and jobs. When people choose Canada, help build Canada, and make sacrifices in support of Canada, we should make it easier for them to formally become Canadian.
Earlier this year, the Government announced measures to grant permanent residency to people who, although not Canadian citizens, had cared for the most vulnerable in long-term care homes and other medical facilities.
The Government will continue to bring in newcomers and support family reunification. We know that there is an economic and human advantage to having families together.
As part of both the short-term economic recovery and a long-term plan for growth, the Government will leverage the advantage we have on immigration to keep Canada competitive on the world stage.

CANADA IN THE WORLD
We must take action on all of these priorities at home. But we must also address the world in which we live. COVID-19 has accelerated the existing trends toward a more fragmented global order. It remains in Canada’s interest to create and maintain bilateral and multilateral relationships to advance peace and economic prosperity.
The Government will invest more in international development while supporting developing countries on their economic recoveries and resilience. Canada will also support work to ensure that people around the world have access to a vaccine. We cannot eliminate this pandemic in Canada unless we end it everywhere.
The Government will also continue to stand up for human rights and the rule of law. It is unacceptable that any citizen be arbitrarily detained. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor must be brought home. This is something for which all Canadians stand united.
The Government will continue to fight for free trade, including by leading the Ottawa Group to reform the World Trade Organization.
Our likeminded allies and partners are investing to make sure their societies emerge stronger. This Government’s plan does that as well.",""

Building a resilient economy means investing in people. But the work does not stop there.

After all, growing the economy and protecting the environment go hand in hand.

By focusing on innovation and good, green jobs, and by working with like-minded countries – we will build a more resilient, sustainable, and competitive economy.

As a country, we want to be leaders in producing the world’s cleanest steel, aluminum, building products, cars, and planes. Not only do we have the raw materials and energy to do that, most importantly, we have skilled, hard-working Canadians to power these industries.

As we move forward on the economy of the future, no worker or region will be left behind. The Government will bring together provinces, territories, municipalities, and Indigenous communities, as well as labour and the private sector, to tap into global capital and attract investors.

Canada will emerge from this generational challenge stronger and more prosperous.

The Government is taking real action to fight climate change. Now, we must go further, faster.

That means moving to cap and cut oil and gas sector emissions, while accelerating our path to a 100 percent net-zero electricity future.

Investing in public transit and mandating the sale of zero emissions vehicles will help us breathe cleaner air.

Increasing the price on pollution while putting more money back in Canadians’ pockets will deliver a cleaner environment and a stronger economy.

Protecting our land and oceans will address biodiversity loss. In this work, the Government will continue to strengthen its partnership with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, to protect nature and respect their traditional knowledge.

Creating the Canada Water Agency will safeguard that vital resource and support our farmers.

And to address the realities communities across the country already face, the Government will also strengthen action to prevent and prepare for floods, wildfires, droughts, coastline erosion, and other extreme weather worsened by climate change. The Government will be there to build back in communities devastated by these events. This will include the development of Canada’s first-ever National Adaptation Strategy.",""

Already, the Government has mandated vaccination for federal and federally-regulated workers, and for everyone travelling within Canada by plane, train, or ship. It has also ensured a standardized Canadian proof of vaccination for domestic and international use.

The Government is securing next generation COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, and doses for kids from 5 to 11.

And around the world, Canada will continue working with its partners to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines and other resources.

To build a healthy future, we must also strengthen our healthcare system and public health supports for all Canadians, especially seniors, veterans, persons with disabilities, vulnerable members of our communities, and those who have faced discrimination by the very system that is meant to heal.

There is work to be done. On accessibility. On care in rural communities. On delayed procedures. On mental health and addiction treatment. On long-term care. On improving data collection across health systems to inform future decisions and get the best possible results.

The Government will work collaboratively with provinces, territories, and other partners to deliver real results on what Canadians need.",""

While we address climate change –
While we fight COVID-19 and its consequences –
While we grow our economy for everyone –
We cannot turn away from other challenges.

Gun violence is on the rise in many of our biggest cities.

While investing in prevention and supporting the work of law enforcement, we must also continue to strengthen gun control.

The Government has taken important actions like introducing lifetime background checks.

The Government will now put forward measures like a mandatory buyback of banned assault-style weapons, and move forward with any province or territory that wants to ban handguns.

During the pandemic, we have also seen an unacceptable rise in violence against women and girls. 

The Government is committed to moving forward with a 10-year National Action Plan on gender-based violence, and will continue to support organizations providing critical services.

When someone in our country is targeted because of their gender, or who they love, or where they come from, the way they pray, the language they speak, or the colour of their skin, we are all diminished.

Everyone should be – and feel – safe.

The Government will continue combatting hate and racism, including with a renewed Anti-Racism Strategy.",""
"id-e1b0d12666eb4fe0b72c02c288970418","Goal","This Is The Moment To Grow A More Resilient Economy","THIS IS THE MOMENT TO GROW A MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY

The best thing we can do for the economy remains ending the pandemic for good. But as we do, we should rebuild an economy that works for everyone. At the height of the lockdowns, the Government made historic, necessary investments so families could keep paying the rent and small businesses could stay afloat.

Now, with one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world, and employment back to pre-pandemic levels, the Government is moving to more targeted support, while
prudently managing spending. 

To ensure no one is left behind, support will be extended or added for industries that continue to struggle.

At the same time, the Government will also continue making life more affordable for all Canadians.

Inflation is a challenge that countries around the world are facing. And while Canada’s economic performance is better than many of our partners, we must keep tackling the rising cost of living. To do that, the Government’s plan includes two major priorities: housing and child care.

Whether it is building more units per year, increasing affordable housing, or ending chronic homelessness, the Government is committed to working with its partners to get real results.

For example, the Housing Accelerator Fund will help municipalities build more and better, faster.

The Government will also help families buy their first home sooner with a more flexible First-Time Home Buyer’s Incentive, a new Rent-to-Own program, and by reducing the closing costs for first-time buyers.

Supporting families will make life more affordable for the middle class and people working hard to join it.

The Canada Child Benefit has already helped lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and will continue increasing to keep up with the cost of living.

The Government will also continue building the first-ever Canada-wide early learning and child care system. By the end of 2022, average fees for regulated child care will be cut in half in most of the provinces and territories. And in some places, this will even happen as early as the start of the year. Families will save thousands of dollars.

Four jurisdictions have not yet reached agreements on child care. Two are territories with unique infrastructure challenges, and the Government will keep working together to ensure we meet the needs of the North. The Government will continue working with the remaining two provinces to finalize agreements that will deliver $10-a-day child care for families who so badly need it.

Investing in affordable child care – just like housing – is not just good for families. It helps grow the entire economy. And so does immigration.

That is why the Government will continue increasing immigration levels and reducing wait times, while supporting family reunification and delivering a world-leading refugee resettlement program.",""

This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves at former residential schools.

We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth. As the Government continues to respond to the Calls to Action, it will invest in that truth, including with the creation of a national monument to honour survivors, and with the appointment of a Special Interlocutor to further advance justice on residential schools.

To support communities, the Government will also invest significantly in a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy, guided by Indigenous Peoples, survivors, and their families.

Everyone in our country deserves to be safe.

That is why the Government will accelerate work with Indigenous partners to address the national tragedy of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People.

The Government will also make sure communities have the support they need to keep families together, while ensuring fair and equitable compensation for those harmed by the First Nations Child and Family Services program.

Reconciliation requires a whole-of-government approach, breaking down barriers, and rethinking how to accelerate our work. Whether it is eliminating all remaining long-term drinking water advisories or implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Government is committed to closing the gaps that far too many First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities still face today.",""

Canadians understand that equity, justice, and diversity are the means and the ends to living together.

Fighting systemic racism, sexism, discrimination, misconduct, and abuse, including in our core institutions, will remain a key priority.

The Government will also continue to reform the criminal justice system and policing.

This is the moment to rebuild for everyone. The Government will continue to invest in the empowerment of Black and racialized Canadians, and Indigenous Peoples. It will also continue to fight harmful content online, and stand up for LGBTQ2 communities while completing the ban on conversion therapy.

As Canadians, our two official languages are part of who we are.

It is essential to support official language minority communities, and to protect and promote French outside and inside Quebec.

The Government will reintroduce the proposed Act for the Substantive Equality of French and English and the Strengthening of the Official Languages Act.

To support Canadian culture and creative industries, the Government will also reintroduce legislation to reform the Broadcasting Act and ensure web giants pay their fair share for the creation and promotion of Canadian content.",""

Section 4.2 of the Department of Justice Act requires the Minister of Justice to prepare a Charter Statement for every government bill to help inform public and Parliamentary debate on government bills. One of the Minister of Justice’s most important responsibilities is to examine legislation for inconsistency with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [“the Charter”]. By tabling a Charter Statement, the Minister is sharing some of the key considerations that informed the review of a bill for inconsistency with the Charter. A Statement identifies Charter rights and freedoms that may potentially be engaged by a bill and provides a brief explanation of the nature of any engagement, in light of the measures being proposed.

A Charter Statement also identifies potential justifications for any limits a bill may impose on Charter rights and freedoms. Section 1 of the Charter provides that rights and freedoms may be subject to reasonable limits if those limits are prescribed by law and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. This means that Parliament may enact laws that limit Charter rights and freedoms. The Charter will be violated only where a limit is not demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society.

A Charter Statement is intended to provide legal information to the public and Parliament on a bill’s potential effects on rights and freedoms that are neither trivial nor too speculative. It is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of all conceivable Charter considerations. Additional considerations relevant to the constitutionality of a bill may also arise in the course of Parliamentary study and amendment of a bill. A Statement is not a legal opinion on the constitutionality of a bill.",""

This limited eligibility criteria could potentially engage section 15 as it creates a distinction based on age.

In seeking to address barriers and improve access to dental care for children, Part 1 of the Bill is in keeping with the purpose of section 15 to promote substantive equality and prevent discrimination against disadvantaged groups. Subsection 15(2) of the Charter clarifies that subsection 15(1) does not preclude laws, programs, or activities that have as their object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or group, including those that are disadvantaged because of age.",""

Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill would establish offences including to knowingly use false identity information or another person’s identity information to obtain a benefit, or to counsel another person to apply for a benefit with an intent to steal all or a substantial part of that person’s benefit. Part 1 of the Bill would also create an offence to knowingly make three or more representations on one or more applications that are false or misleading if the total amount of the benefits that were or would have been paid as a result of the applications is at least $5,000.

Section 7 of the Charter protects against the deprivation of an individual’s life, liberty and security of the person unless done in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. Because the offences carry the possibility of imprisonment, they have the potential to deprive liberty and so must accord with the principles of fundamental justice.

In reviewing the relevant measures, the Minister of Justice has not identified any potential inconsistencies of the offence provisions with the principles of fundamental justice under section 7.

An eligible parent could apply for the dental benefit in each of the two benefit periods, and the amount of the dental benefit would depend on the adjusted family net income of the applicant.

• Simplified registration – the project will streamline the federal MSCA and CRA My Account registration process for QC residents with a QC Digital Identity by relying on an approved Provincial TDI instead of a federal credential and federal identity proofing.
• Enhanced client services – streamlined access by eliminating the need to create multiple usernames and passwords and provide duplicate personal information to each level of government to access programs and services.
• Faster access – It will offer real-time access to MSCA by eliminating the requirement for a PAC for identity validation purposes (for those that do not have access to Verified.Me via one of the six available financial institutions).
This benefit will be measured by:
1) The number of new QC clients using their QC Digital Identity to register in real time to MSCA (out of the total number of QC residents that have an MSCA Account).
2) The percentage of QC clients who register to MSCA via credential substitution for Quebec TDI (out of the total number of QC residents that have a MSCA Account).

It enables Canada’s full and secure participation in the global digital economy through economic sector innovation and the enablement of modernized digital service delivery.

Application architecture practices must evolve significantly for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. Transitioning from legacy systems based on monolithic architectures to architectures that oriented around business services and based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities, is a major shift. Interoperability becomes a key element, and the number of stakeholders that must be considered increases.",""

Whereas working-age persons with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty than working-age persons without disabilities, because of economic and social exclusion;

Whereas persons with disabilities often face barriers to employment, including work disincentives such as the loss of income and other benefits as a result of becoming employed;

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to the economic and social inclusion of persons with disabilities, as evidenced by its introduction of the Accessible Canada Act;

Whereas the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees persons with disabilities the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination;

Whereas reducing poverty contributes to the progressive realization of Canada’s international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;

Whereas Canada aspires to be a world leader in the eradication of poverty, and Parliament, with a view to this objective, enacted the Poverty Reduction Act;

Whereas progress made by Canada in reducing poverty for persons with disabilities and others contributes to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations;

Whereas the Government of Canada seeks to build on its successes in addressing poverty through providing benefits for seniors and for families with children;

Whereas, in the spirit of “Nothing Without Us”, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance, in developing support measures for persons with disabilities, of engaging with the disability community, in accordance with the Accessible Canada Act, which specifies that “persons with disabilities must be involved in the development and design of laws, policies, programs, services and structures”;

And whereas Parliament recognizes the leading role that the provinces and territories play in providing supports and services to persons with disabilities and the importance of engaging with them in developing income supports and other support services;",""

Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.",""

Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.",""

2. Implementing the amendments to regulations, which are mandatory, in a timely manner will ensure that employers are being held to the commitments made and are being inspected against the new conditions starting in September 2022 and onwards; 
3. Regulatory changes will protect the TFWs employed in Canada:
o by ensuring they have access to emergency medical care paid by the employer before they become eligible by provincial health care system;
o by ensuring they are given information on their rights in Canada before or the first day of work;
o by ensuring they are provided a written employment contract so they are aware of the terms and conditions of their employment before or on the first day of work.
4. Suspension of employer’s LMIA application assessment, when there is a reason to suspect that the employer may not be complying with certain conditions, will protect the TFWs from serious harm and it will stop the employer from employing new TFWs until the allegations are addressed. It also strengthens program integrity and protects the Canadian labour market and standards of living. ",""
