This is the result of work carried out in the Danish Datamanagement Forum activity Data Management by Design in 2018. 

Reading through this report in its printed form may not be the best way to experience it. The imformation is far better presented by loading the model into an architecture model browser or using a web brewser to view the onlibe HTML version. Look at the projects GiHub page for decriptions of how best to browse the model from which this report is generated.

https://github.com/Data-Management-by-Design/DMbD

The Data Management by Design activity had partisipation from these danish universities:

 - Aalborg University
 - The University of Southern Denmark
 - Technical University of Denmark
 - Copenhagen Business School
 - University of Copenhagen

The activity was funded by Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation (DeiC) and Denmarks Electronic Research Library (DEFF)

Notice: During the activity it was deemed most productive to only use a small subset of the Archimate modelling language, namely; drivers, goals, stakeholders, and requirements. The modelling of relations has been reduced to only model simple association, and where it is very obvious compositions. The simplified modelleing is carried through to this report. It is the intension that this will be used as the startingpoint for at more evolved model of the common ground for research data management in a university setting.",""

If you are using one of our pre-installed Windows computers, you can find your document area under ""Libraries"" and then ""Documents"". If you are using a pre-installed Windows computer, your documents are automatically synchronised; this means that you can always find an updated version of your files on your hard drive and on the server.

If several users need to work on the same files, you can use a group folder, called a fileshare. If you need a fileshare, simply send an email to support@its.aau.dk in which you include the desired name of your fileshare and the name (username) of the users who need access to the fileshare.

You will gain access to your own files on all your devices, and you can access these files anywhere via VPN.

If you are using your own Windows computer, a Mac computer or the Linux OS, you need to manually connect to your document area.

For pre-test analysis, finite element simulation models are employed. During experiments blade conditions are monitored e.g. with strain gauges, thermometer, accelerometer, and high-speed footage to create a realtime digital twin, effective metadata tagging for results is needed. Carrying out experiments is expensive and hence there is an economical incentive to properly document experimental setting and results to avoid duplicating work. This entails standardisation of data formats across- and within stakeholder institutions, i.e. a standardised catalogue of data and thorough metadata is required. Though at the same time, depending on the funding source, vendors must/cannot be guaranteed exclusive access to the dataset, so the standardised data repository will need to accommodate granular permission requirements depending on contractual obligations.

LSF's data repository hosting and access management, as well as underlying infrastructure (servers, filesystems) and QoS (guaranteed uptime), could be handled by a third party, leading to requirements for
• agreed service levels

These are generated from global meteorological datasets and high-resolution land surface data using an open source regional weather model in combination with a high-resolution microscale flow model. The project offers a web interface similar to Google Maps, where the user can do ad-hoc analysis on the servers hosting the data or interactively mark a range of variables for an area of interest and download the data for further processing locally.  

WA is EU financed and are obliged to make the promised datasets publicly available from April'19 and five years onwards. This relates to the following requirements listed;
• Contractual compliance (push to publication in this case? Contractual compliance is in this case ""anti-NDA"")
• Push to publication
• Service reliability according to SLA
• Slice data into subsets (I and R in FAIR; interoperability, reusability)
• Reuse data, workflows, software, environment etc. (research integrity, research efficiency)
• Sufficient technical capability of platform according to research scenario (functional requirements)
• Continuously available data collection (long, non-reproducible data series, SLA)

An SDUCloud application is a tool created to facilitate analysis of data and runs in the ""cloud"". The app store acts as a directory of tools. Tools can be tagged and searched for. 
Each tool contains a concrete and machine readable description of the tool. This
metadata includes, among others, software versions, fields, and references to
documentation.

During the design of the SDUCloud compute platform we had a large focus on
reproducibility, automation, and traceability. We implemented reproducibility
by using Docker for managing the software stack inside of applications.
Docker allows to create a ""container"" of software in the exact versions needed. These containers are portable and can easily move between different hardware.

When an application is executed, the platform saves job results and job parameters
to a system folder in the user virtual drive. This step archives both the results
and input parameters, allowing to re-run the application at a later point in
time.

We plan to extend the platform to allow the composition of individual applications together to create a workflow. We define workflows using machine readable documents, like the ones used for applications.

This includes large datasets, as well as sensitive or confidential data. 
The storage support provided by SDUCloud is similar in functionality to the many other ""cloud storage"" solutions, e.g. OneDrive, Google Drive and, Dropbox. We provide a ""virtual drive"" for both research projects (shared folders) and personal accounts (private documents).

Keeping sensitive data requires to perform strict access control and
detailed logging. For this we implemented a system-wide audit of all operations in the system. The system also supports encryption at rest and in transit.

All research projects in the system have associated structured metadata. This
includes the project's data management plan. A structured data management
plan allows us to standardize certain parts of it. We can, for example,
automatically destroy/preserve data at the end of a project, or perform scheduled backups.

As research is commonly a collaborative discipline, the platform supports
sharing of individual files/folders with other users. It is possible to grant
limited or full access to files.

The SDUCloud platform aims to make data discoverable. 
We have implemented support in the system for attaching metadata to individual files and make it searchable. We are also planning to further implement domain specific metadata.
