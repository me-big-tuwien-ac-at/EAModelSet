To make that decision easier for the public health authorities, and to help ease the impact that science- and evidence-based decisions can have on local businesses in the short term, the Government will work to target additional financial support directly to businesses which have to temporarily shut down as a result of a local public health decision.&#xD;

      <documentation>With the job losses that Canadians have faced, it became clear early on that many people would need help until they could find work once again. But existing income support systems were not designed to handle this unprecedented situation. That’s why the Government moved quickly to create the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as a temporary program to help millions of Canadians get through a very difficult time. &#xD;
With the economic restart now well underway, CERB recipients should instead be supported by the Employment Insurance system. For people who would not traditionally qualify for EI, the Government will create the transitional Canada Recovery Benefit.</documentation>

      <documentation>TB’s Policy on Service and Digital is estimated to have 247 requirements applying to the departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) function. Along with this are key changes, which produce new expectations for Deputy Heads in the areas of service, information and data, technology, cyber security, as well as workforce capacity and capability. To comply with the Policy, a methodological gap analysis was performed by IITB teams to determine the policy-driven requirements based on five themes: &#xD;
 Governance, planning and reporting (as it relates to IT governance and planning within ESDC);&#xD;
 Service Design and Delivery;&#xD;
 Information and Data;&#xD;
 Technology (including automated decision making); and,&#xD;
 Cyber Security and Identity.&#xD;
The gap analysis looked at IITB’s existing investments and priorities and made 12 recommendations for IITB to either create new initiatives or reprioritize its portfolio of activities. Most of these recommendations are already in progress as part of the IITB Way Forward. The top five prioritized recommendations are:&#xD;
 Clarify the role and responsibilities between the CDO and the CIO;&#xD;
 Establish the role of a designated official for Cyber Security (DOCS);&#xD;
 Review IM/IT and Identity Policies to address redundancy, conflicts, user-centered policy writing, and training;&#xD;
 Harmonize the different service inventories for a single source of truth; and,&#xD;
 Formalize automated decision-making governance at ESDC.&#xD;
These recommendations reflect the integrated management of functions as expected by the Policy, the increased responsibilities of the CIO, and the unique governance entities within ESDC (e.g. use of a CDO, a Chief Security Officer outside the branch of the CIO, and a tier 2 level committee focused on purely on service). &#xD;
In addition, the Branches within the Department have been collaborating internally to improve service delivery and digital transformation:&#xD;
 Business Architecture and Alignment Office participates regularly at EA activities as one of the EA domains in developing project architectures; &#xD;
 User Experience Team provides UX research and design services to IT project teams regularly; and,&#xD;
 Business Process Management Team provides guidance and services on business process mapping to IT project teams regularly.</documentation>

      <documentation>Business Architecture&#xD;
&#xD;
Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.&#xD;
Design services digitally from end‑to‑end to meet the Government of Canada users and other stakeholders’ needs&#xD;
Clearly identify internal and external users and other stakeholders and their needs for each policy, program and business service&#xD;
In order to ensure that a service will be able to meet the users and stakeholders' needs, it needs to understand what needs it is trying to provide service for, who their users and stakeholders are, both internal and external.&#xD;
Once the needs, the users and stakeholders are defined, then a service provider can proceed to create a stakeholder mapping to further understand the relationship between the service and the users &amp; stakeholders, ie. how a change in one component impacts the other.&#xD;
From there, the service provider can conduct need analysis of its users and stakeholder to develop a program, a policy or a service that meets their needs (this practice may also be known as stakeholder requirements or value mapping).&#xD;
This exercise can also help define the limitation/scope of the program/policy/service to better manage the expectation of their users/stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * summarize the needs and outcome of each key external and internal stakeholders in scope of the architecture&#xD;
    * demonstrate how the architecture is focused on the needs and outcomes of internal and external stakeholders&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Case&#xD;
    * Stakeholder (Actors, Roles, Organizational Units) Mapping &amp; Stakeholder requirements &#xD;
    * Outcomes&#xD;
    * Business Process Map&#xD;
    * Value Stream and Value Mapping&#xD;
&#xD;
include policy requirement applying to specific users and other stakeholder groups, such as accessibility, gender-based plus analysis, and official languages in the creation of the service&#xD;
To ensure that a service can be used by all its users, it is important to note the specific requirements for specific users and to that extent, it is important to take note and apply the policy that governs the service standards when providing service to the specific user groups.&#xD;
This will in turn enable the service to be far-reaching and more inclusive to all its users.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline what policies constrain the architecture&#xD;
    * Outline positive and negative impact the policy has on the architecture to meet the needs of the stakeholder&#xD;
    * Outline how architecture supports full spectrum of service design and user experience&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * User Interface Design Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
perform Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) to support risk mitigation activities when deploying an automated decision system as per Directive on Automated Decision-Making&#xD;
When a service has an in-system developed automation for decision making, it is essential that the service perform AIA, to ensure that the result of this decision making is impartial and fair, and the impact of that decision would be the same as if the decision is made manually, only faster.&#xD;
The use of this type of system must closely follow the Directive on Automated Decision-Making.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Provide the impact level based on the completion of the conceptual AIA&#xD;
    * Describe how the architecture will address the recommendations coming from the AIA&#xD;
    * Describe how the architecture meets the directive's requirements for the impact level&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * AIA Results (Conceptual)&#xD;
&#xD;
Model end-to-end business service delivery to provide quality, maximize effectiveness and optimize efficiencies across all channels (for example, lean process)&#xD;
When creating a service, make sure the service delivery is modeled end-to-end to make sure the intended end users can actually reap the benefit of the service being offered.&#xD;
Go through the business process map step-by-step to ensure all points/nodes within the process behaves expectedly resulting in an intended outcome.&#xD;
Ensure all points/nodes within the process is optimized.&#xD;
Create all possible positive and negative scenarios that can possibly occur.&#xD;
Then go through different possible scenarios to ensure the service is still being delivered correctly, effectively and efficiently.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Summarize the delivery of value to customer across the architecture’s  business ecosystem  and the contribution of each stakeholder to the value&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Process Map&#xD;
    * Business Impact Assessment&#xD;
    * Value Stream and Value Mapping&#xD;
&#xD;
Architect to be outcome‑driven and strategically aligned to the department and to the Government of Canada&#xD;
identify which departmental/GC business services, outcomes and strategies will be addressed&#xD;
To ensure that the Government of Canada provide the best service to its citizen, the services provided needs to be cohesive, ie. the work conducted by each department needs to complement each other to avoid overlap and to ensure continuance of service from one department to another.&#xD;
In order for a service to be meaningful, it needs to be tied into the driver of why the service is required and the outcome expected from a departmental mandate. The service can affect the mandate directly/indirectly, however, one needs to justify the needs of the service in relation to the actual mandate of the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline the GC/Departmental Strategies the architect aligns and/or implements&#xD;
    * Describe the architecture's contribution to realizing the appropriate outcomes of the strategy&#xD;
   Artifacts:&#xD;
    * Drivers&#xD;
    * Outcomes (intimidate and ultimate)&#xD;
    * Business services (External)&#xD;
&#xD;
establish metrics for identified business outcomes throughout the life cycle of an investment&#xD;
Once we know which outcome that a service is tied into, and whether or not it is directly affecting the outcome expected, we need to be able to justify the effort required to build the service vs. the outcome exerted by the service.&#xD;
We need a way to quantify the impact of this service / establish a metrics for this service.&#xD;
This is an important step to ensure that we can prioritize the effort correctly to identify and build the right service that is of high priority with the budget assigned.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * What are the metrics used to ensure that the outcomes are being realized&#xD;
    * What data is required for the metrics and identify how any gaps in the data will be addressed.&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Value Stream (Measure KPI linked to benefits outcomes and objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
translate business outcomes and strategy into business capability implications in the GC Business Capability Model to establish a common vocabulary between business, development, and operation&#xD;
Once we understood the outcomes and strategy to achieve the outcome, we need to translate it into business capability implications. Historically, the Business Capability Model is a common vocabulary between business, development and operation.&#xD;
When the plan conveyed is understood by the development and operation, it would be easier to obtain the system required.&#xD;
Having an open communication between the various teams also helps in getting the right solution that closely match the business requirement.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline the business capabilities involved in achieving each outcome&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Impact Assessment&#xD;
    * Departmental BCM&#xD;
    * GC BCM (mapping to D BCM)&#xD;
    * Value Stream&#xD;
Promote horizontal enablement of the enterprise&#xD;
identify opportunities to enable business services horizontally across the GC enterprise and to provide cohesive experience to users and other stakeholders&#xD;
In creating any service, we always need to go back to think about the users/stakeholders. Put ourselves in the users'/stakeholders' shoes. If we are at the receiving end of the service, what kind of experience do we get when we are trying to get the service. Does the user need to know where to get related services, or can we provide them with a seamless service, a cohesive service ? How do we provide a good experience to the users / stakeholders ?&#xD;
We need to start thinking more of an enterprise level, starting at the departmental level first. How can we enable this service across the department ? Is there any opportunity to reuse what we have in other areas of the department ? What do we need to do to leverage this process ?&#xD;
We need to plug in to community of practices, network of expertise or other working groups in order to exchange information, understand the various obstacles experienced by others, get lessons learned from others' experiences, share lessons learned, learn from others how they overcome similar obstacles in their work, share your solutions to others.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Summarize the departmental / GC opportunities where the architecture could be reused&#xD;
    * Summarize departmental/GC architectures that impact or influence the ability of the user having a cohesive experience&#xD;
       (what are the plans to ensure user has a cohesive experience across these architectures and the ecosystem)&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Capability&#xD;
    * Departmental Value Stream model&#xD;
    * Projects to Value Stream Script&#xD;
&#xD;
reuse common business capabilities, processes and enterprise solutions from across government and private sector&#xD;
If there is a business capabilities, processes or enterprise solution that can be utilized in creating the service, eg. perhaps during the exchange of information from working groups, community of practices, workshops or even from working with private sectors, that are proven to work, we should consider using it prior to inventing our own.&#xD;
This will optimize the time required to build the approach or the solution. Rather than having to proof the concept or solution actually works, use the ones that have a proven record.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Describe the plan and approach to standardize the realization of the business capability so it can be reused within the department and GC&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Projects to value Stream Script&#xD;
    * Business Capability Heat map&#xD;
&#xD;
publish in the open all reusable common business capabilities, processes and enterprise solutions for others to develop and leverage cohesive horizontal enterprise services&#xD;
Going back to the previous point on thinking at an enterprise level, one of the ways to enable a service that we build across the GC is by having it published in the open for other departments to see and re-use. Then and only we can create a cohesive horizontal enterprise services to create a cohesive experience to the users / stakeholders.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline the plan to allow other public sector organizations to reuse the common capability&#xD;

&#xD;
Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.&#xD;

&#xD;
The Citizens First series takes an in depth look at how citizens experience government services. Over the years, Canadians have been asked what they think about the delivery of public services, what are their expectations, and what they see as the priorities for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
Use the research findings to gain a deeper understanding of how citizens experience government services. This knowledge enables you, as a service provider, to improve service based on a citizen perspective and empirical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Background&#xD;
Originally published in 1998, Citizens First was coined as a landmark study that focused on citizen-centred service delivery. Over the years, the Citizens First series has changed and grown, introducing new elements and increasing the depth of understanding of how citizens experience government services.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Citizens First series has established the gold-standard for research on public sector service delivery, not only in Canada, but around the world. The distinctive methodology and approach have equipped public sector managers with the tools they need to identify action priorities for service improvement in the public sector.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Set Up Your Environment (Course of Action)" id="id-ed6f7326897443b7ab7c402c2a6ed104">
      <documentation>Set up your Environment&#xD;
Your virtual workspace may consist of a variety of tools and platforms.&#xD;
Software developers and IT folks may leverage social coding platforms such as Gitlab, Github, GCcode, etc., to collaborate widely with people around the world on source code.&#xD;
In the Government of Canada, most departments now use Microsoft 365 to varying degrees, which may include Teams, a collaboration platform that ties in multiple products and capabilities.&#xD;
Whether you are using the corporate collaboration platform or a 3rd party software as service to work in the open, there are a number of things to keep in mind.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Stay in Control (Course of Action)" id="id-5fab96f8de614f10813b4cf00842dd75">
      <documentation>Stay in Control&#xD;
Your workspace is a very important place: it contains your work and you have a responsibility to ensure its properly secured and controlled. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t open up securely.&#xD;
Proper access management is required so that we can separate the two main types of users: your team’s members and external contributors. The latter could be a person from within your organization or from the public.&#xD;
There may be more types of roles available depending on the platforms, but these are the main buckets we think of when working in the open.&#xD;
Depending on the platform you use, various controls may be offered to let you openly share your documents and your work while remaining in control of its content.&#xD;
In SharePoint, a platform most often available as “Inner Source” only, a team can open up their workspace by default to their colleagues and create specific folders with more restricted access to privately work on documents only when absolutely required.&#xD;
With most collaboration platforms, whether it’s SharePoint, Google Docs, etc., there usually is an option to let external contributors consult your documents and add comments but prevent them from making changes directly. This way, you remain in control of the main version but you enable people to stop by and provide feedback on a continuous basis. Additionally, such platforms usually offer a functionality that let the owner of the documents revert changes made by someone else, ensuring that only approved changes remain on your official versions that will be kept for information management purposes.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Ensure Privacy (Course of Action)" id="id-a8acef8a5e7741509bfb1ea446e17338">
      <documentation>Ensure Privacy&#xD;
Public servants who work with citizen data must take great care regarding the privacy of that data and never share it publicly. Working in the open by default is not a concept that applies when working on a citizen’s files and data.&#xD;
&#xD;
But it doesn’t mean that even these teams can’t work openly on improving their processes and sharing how they overcomed challenges. As public servants, we should continuously strive to improve our processes, look for new ways of solving issues, and share the results of our research, as long as they are unclassified.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Manage Secrets (Course of Action)" id="id-f619cacdec8d4dd1be048460b1b0819a">
      <documentation>Manage Secrets&#xD;
In software development, certain parts of the final code may be a corporate secret, such as a private key to a computer resource, passwords, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
These must never be included in the public source code itself but rather be managed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since, software source code is nothing more than structured text that can be understood by a computer, the same concept of pulling out secrets parts may be taken with other types of documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
This means that when a small part of your work must not be shared publicly, you can exclude it and store it in a secure location instead of locking down the entire document.&#xD;
&#xD;
This way, the material that is unclassified can still be made available publicly and may be collectively worked on while the parts that are to be secured can be edited separately only by the select individuals who are authorized.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Manage Leaks (Course of Action)" id="id-17315b4645054a48a85f069282af67a7">
      <documentation>Manage Leaks&#xD;
In software development, we expect that there will be a security issue at some point, while we continue to strive to minimize that eventuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
By putting in place a remediation process, we ensure that even if there was to be a leak, appropriate mesures are in place to address it as quickly as possible. And we make sure that everyone knows how to run through the process, if it’s not fully automated.&#xD;
&#xD;
For traditional text documents and presentations, reducing the amount of specific data used may help minimize the risks of leaks. However, someone could inadvertently type a password or personal information in a document.&#xD;
&#xD;
If that was the case, since it is not software related and automation may not be as easily possible, it would be important that each member of your team is familiar with the departmental Directive on Privacy Breach and know exactly what to do and who to contact.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Open Up At Inception (Course of Action)" id="id-0574d79db6cf43ffa39c80478604be16">
      <documentation>Open up at Inception&#xD;
Part of working in the open is accepting that we don’t know what others may be able to contribute to or when they would be able to jump in to help. By making your documents open at their inception, you put yourself from the get go in a mental state where you expect others to read and possibly participate whenever it makes sense for them, not just when you plan a formal review. In a way, you change how you perceive your own work.&#xD;
&#xD;
It’s a normal reaction to think that we can do better before getting feedback, which is why you may be tempted to wait until “it’s good enough to share”. But doing so may lead you to wait until very late in the creation process and you may actually never end up opening up for a variety of reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
For example, you may have to go back and review the document to ensure you haven’t unconsciously added sensitive or classified information, which adds work and delays. Or, you may feel less receptive to feedback as you get closer to a final version of a document since you spent so much time aligning your ideas together and wordsmithing.&#xD;
&#xD;
As explained in our previous post, working in the open is a participatory approach which includes public reflection and documentation. The process itself is as important as the final document.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Be Humble and Open Minded (Course of Action)" id="id-e3730df7458048a19b4b4ff93553b548">
      <documentation>Be Humble and Open Minded&#xD;
Working in the open may seem like putting yourself out there, subject to criticism and judgement of others.&#xD;
&#xD;
But remember that no one knows everything. Opening up is an opportunity for you and your team to share what you are working on and enable unique collaboration experiences with colleagues and citizens alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
This approach is what made open source software projects so powerful and adopted across the whole world. It is also a good way to align with the Directive on Open Government as mentioned earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
Of course, the official review process can still occur for each major revision of your documents. You simply ensure that in between such versions, the creation process is done openly and enables folks from all backgrounds to contribute.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Manage the Community (Course of Action)" id="id-d80f8c60473b43cd8e1d94c1ddd052fc">
      <documentation>Manage the Community&#xD;
An argument sometimes used for avoiding working in the open is that managing the community may end up being more work than what you get back. Or that receiving external contributions before a certain version is mature enough would slow you down.&#xD;
&#xD;
Based on our experience, small and continuous feedback makes the process much less cognitively intensive since contributions usually are smaller and can be more easily integrated in the workflow. It also helps identify issues early on so that side discussions may occur on those specifically. And by continuously reviewing and integrating the feedback, it helps minimize the disruption of the entire creation effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
As mentioned before, this approach has to be participatory. It means that you have to set the stage, explain what you are trying to accomplish and welcome those contributions from all around.&#xD;
&#xD;
And encourage external folks to comment. Make sure you reply to them either by simply acknowledging you have read their contributions or by letting them know what will be done about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since we abide by a code of values and ethics, clearly outline what is tolerated and what is not. Be clear within your team that this is something that is beneficial and help new comers to feel comfortable with the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
You may be surprised as to who ends up contributing! Be welcoming, open minded, and inclusive. Not everyone has the same background and life experiences. We can learn from everyone and grow better together!</documentation>

      <documentation>Build a platform for enterprise interoperability (actions underway)&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS will continue to work with stakeholders to develop a unified service approach and to create a set of modern integration tools called the GC Interoperability Platform (GCIP). This platform acts as an information broker, enabling the exchange of data and information between enterprise systems, departments and governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
The GCIP project will implement a central data exchange where information can be shared securely and reliably between government applications. Three core solutions for financial management, human resource management and information management will be connected to seamlessly exchange information, regardless of the technologies underpinning them. These systems operate on a “tell us once” principle, where data is entered in one system and then reused by multiple other systems, as legislation and policy permit, thus reducing the need for duplicate data entry while improving data integrity and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
This work will lay the foundation to link internal departmental information with solutions for delivering programs and services and enable greater GC-wide collaboration when designing digital services.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS will continue to lead the adoption of a common GCIP to support information sharing inside and outside the GC domain. This approach will enable business process improvement within the government and across jurisdictions, leading to improved program and service delivery for citizens and businesses.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Through the creation and use of a governance framework (policies, directives, guidelines and open standards) for the GCIP, TBS will:&#xD;
• foster openness and collaboration&#xD;
• promote digital services&#xD;
• advance enterprise interoperability and information sharing across the government</documentation>

      <documentation>Introduce a strategy for use of open source software and open standards (planned actions)&#xD;
&#xD;
The use of open source software supports interoperability and information sharing and should be considered in the assessment of IM-IT solutions. Open source products are publicly available, and the availability of their source code promotes open and collaborative development around their specifications, making them more robust and interoperable. The use of open standards ensures interoperability between products and systems, and maintains flexibility within the IM-IT environment. TBS will lead the development of a strategy to set direction for the government on the use and release of open source software and open standards that will be ratified by GC EARB.</documentation>

      <documentation>Introduce a mobile application strategy and framework (planned actions)&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians and business want to use mobile applications to interact with government data and obtain government services. As part of the overall web strategy, TBS will lead the development of a strategy and framework for the development and management of mobile applications that are easy to use and trusted that will be validated through GC EARB. GC mobile applications will be identified on Canada.ca and available through application stores.</documentation>

      <documentation>Introduce a government API store (actions underway)&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS will lead the creation of an API store to support information sharing with Canadians, business and other entities external to government. Departments have already made available a number of APIs. The GC API store will offer a consistent means to discovering APIs and subscribing to them. The store will provide API publishers and users with a central, multi-tenant API management platform that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
• a searchable catalogue&#xD;
• version control&#xD;
• automated access provisioning workflows&#xD;
&#xD;
Operating under a self-service model, API publishers will be allowed to sign up and benefit from “active documentation” that allows them to drill into API definitions, try APIs and share their feedback in the store’s forum.&#xD;
&#xD;
Interoperability, mobile applications and APIs are key elements to supporting digital services for the GC.</documentation>

      <documentation>Enhance online infrastructure to enable departments to release their data and information (actions underway)&#xD;
&#xD;
Having reliable infrastructure in place to ensure the maximum release of government data and information ultimately results in:&#xD;
&#xD;
• a platform for Canadians that enables access to open government data and information&#xD;
• the opportunity to meaningfully engage on related issues&#xD;
The long-term goals of these activities are to deliver value to Canadians through open information and data that:&#xD;
&#xD;
• fosters greater citizen participation in government&#xD;
• promotes innovation&#xD;
• creates economic opportunities&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s Open Data Exchange (ODX) is an organization that helps Canadian companies make use of open data. TBS will work with the ODX to deepen insight into the commercial open data landscape and to understand what challenges need to be overcome in order to make Canadian open data companies more competitive.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Develop A Master Data Management Program" id="id-0e8c0dbc598c41cf822642e310fa328b">
      <documentation>Develop a master data management program (planned actions)&#xD;
&#xD;
In an open and distributed operational environment such as the GC, there is a risk that business-critical data becomes redundant, inconsistent and scattered throughout the enterprise.&#xD;
&#xD;
Master data management (MDM) can be defined as the processes, governance, tools, rules and technology required to create and maintain consistent and accurate master data. It focuses on common critical data elements and establishes strong governance around them. MDM can eliminate redundancy and inconsistency of data in an organization and ensure its quality and control. It can provide a single, authoritative point of reference that can be shared by many processes and applications across the organization. It can also streamline data sharing and facilitate interoperability.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS will work with key business owners (for example, the Office of the Comptroller General and the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer) to establish a government-wide MDM program to formally identify standard data elements and single authoritative sources for key information domains, where appropriate.</documentation>

      <documentation>Advance analytics (planned actions)&#xD;
&#xD;
Business intelligence involves creating, aggregating, analyzing and visualizing data to inform and facilitate business management and strategy. Analytics is about asking questions and refers to all the ways in which data can be broken down, compared and examined for trends. Big data is the technology that stores and processes data and information in datasets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications can’t analyze them. Big data can make available almost limitless amounts of information, improving data-driven decision making and expanding open data initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS, working with departments, will lead the development of requirements for an enterprise analytics platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS will work with departments to identify a business lead to develop a data lake (a repository of raw data) service strategy so that the GC can take advantage of big data and market innovation to foster better analytics and promote horizontal data sharing.</documentation>

      <documentation>Implement a platform for external collaboration (actions underway)&#xD;
&#xD;
Technology makes it easier for citizens, academia, scientists, businesses and government to share ideas and information and to collaborate with one another. TBS will lead the establishment of an external collaboration service provider to host departments and provide them with a dedicated workspace and computing storage for unclassified and transitory data. Cloud pilot projects will test-drive requirements and determine the most suitable platform to meet government business, information and security needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS, in collaboration with departments, including PSPC and SSC, provides departments with a secure platform called GCCollab to:&#xD;
&#xD;
• share opinions, information and analyses&#xD;
• collaborate with external partners, academia, businesses, other governments and citizens&#xD;
&#xD;
While meeting the government’s requirements for security classification, disposition and recordkeeping, the platform will support an array of functions such as document sharing, co-authoring, assigning tasks, organizing meetings and holding discussions.</documentation>

      <documentation>Implement GCDOCS (actions underway)&#xD;
&#xD;
Time and productivity are frequently lost due to the lack of consistent tools and systems to help employees store, search and find the information and data they need to do their jobs. Enterprise IM solutions such as GCDOCS streamline and simplify these processes, but they need to be configured properly to make back-end IM processes as invisible as possible to users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Automation can provide opportunities to:&#xD;
&#xD;
• simplify and streamline key IM processes and practices&#xD;
• deliver a seamless user experience that relieves burden on individual GC workers&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, implementing integrated and standardized solutions across departments can help make it easier for GC employees to find, use and share the information and data they need to do their job, while ensuring consistent, foundational management of GC information assets. Information and data can be leveraged to help departments achieve their business objectives and meet their mandated requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS and PSPC will enhance the government-wide GCDOCS service for departments, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
• full deployment by 2022&#xD;
• broadening its integration with back office systems&#xD;
• piloting its use as a tool for increasing the openness of government information</documentation>

“Event-driven architectures (EDA) is inherently intermediated. Therefore, the intermediating role of event brokering is a definitional part of EDA. All implementations of event-driven applications must use some technology in the role of an event broker.”*&#xD;

      <documentation>Enforcement investigations are seeking to establish evidence of “guilty mind” by the subject, compared to compliance investigations that are seeking to establish and adjudicate on the conduct of “guilt acts” by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
As ISB’s Enforcement investigations function continues to mature, maintaining the status quo poses significant challenges to workload, case management, intelligence gathering, security of information, and operational reporting. There is also a real risk that ISB may have a case thrown out of court or rejected by the Public Prosecution Services of Canada (PPSC) based on a loss of evidence that would normally be included in a proper enforcement case management system. ISB requires a system to support Enforcement investigations that will replace the system(s) currently in use, which is not meeting the needs of enforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enforcement function is in need of an effective case management system capable of supporting effective workload management, unified case management, the release of quality court documents, tracking of evidence and reporting. The Office of the Auditor General (OAG), in its 2017 spring report “Managing the Risk of Fraud”, noted the following “fraud in a federal government organization can cause the loss of public money or property, hurt employee morale, and undermine Canadians’ confidence in public services. Therefore, federal organizations must manage their fraud risks.”1 The lack of an effective case management system within ISB is limiting the ability of ISB to support robust investigations and achieve ESDC strategic objectives. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Enforcement function&#xD;
Currently, the Enforcement division utilizes a SharePoint site developed as a response to the critical shortcomings and abandonment of the Major Investigation and Sensitive Case Information System (MISCIS) as a case management system. MISCIS was an MS-Access database with limited functionality that did not meet business objectives. In addition, this solution had no workflow management and was not designed to be a case management system or a long-term solution to respond to current operational risks. An internal audit conducted by ISB in 2014 outlined the immediate need to develop and implement a robust and comprehensive case management system to manage the increase of enforcement investigations, aligned to key stages of the investigation workflow, and to help provide a framework for the separation of Enforcement and Compliance functions§. The report also highlighted the importance in consistency of evidence building in our processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
[2.3.1] Enforcement Function&#xD;
Cases handled by the ISB Enforcement NEID and regional investigators are maintained using a SharePoint system and Excel sheets to track cases. &#xD;
Enforcement investigations previously used MISCIS as a reporting tool to keep NHQ informed of the nature of a case, objectives, strategy, participants, partners, status and outcome of cases involving sensitivity and/or fraud characteristics MISCIS did not support day-to-day case processing. As a result, it was deemed impractical by investigators and was completely discounted as non-operational.&#xD;
Cases are managed at the regional level, without a common and robust case management system; current data on ongoing criminal investigations is unreliable, as the case management system (SharePoint) is not built into a robust process. SharePoint also does not meet the court-mandated investigation tracking, evidence tracking, documentation security and disclosure requirements for enforcement investigations. There is minimal system-level security around the criminal cases and investigators see each other’s files, and team leaders see files belonging to all of their investigators. SharePoint lacks any suitable change tracking mechanism for documents that may be modified by others than the author. There is also no suitable safeguards within SharePoint to prevent unauthorized disclosure of info. Once the objectives of transforming the enforcement function are met, this will increase the number of criminal cases initiated by each region, but as of yet no modern, secure, and reliable tool is available to help manage such an increase. The lack of an appropriate case management system puts into jeopardy all enforcement cases.&#xD;
ESDC provides significant public funding (more than $120 billion yearly) to millions of beneficiaries through the EI, CPP and OAS programs. To fulfill ESDC’s commitment to the proper stewardship of these funds, ISB is responsible for preventing, detecting and addressing potential abuse and fraud of these programs. To achieve this mandate, ISB currently performs the majority of its activities in the form of administrative investigations. As a result, the proportion of Enforcement function activities is much smaller than that of the compliance function. A 2016 global study by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) indicates that all types of organizations around the world suffer significant losses due to fraud (estimated between 2.5 and 5% of an organization’s yearly revenue (excluding administrative errors). A scan of reports of fraud loss across major countries—including the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, among others—indicate that between 2.5 and 5% of benefits funds are lost to fraud. While some errors can be caught and fixed through administration functions, the function must be complemented with a strong enforcement regime that can address the complexities associated with a criminal fraud investigation and act as a strong deterrent. ISB has the opportunity to develop a cohesive, integrated, and enterprise-wide system to support the prevention, detection, and resolution of fraud investigations through the development of an enhanced Enforcement CMS, aligned to the Fraud Framework.&#xD;
To support the broader departmental modernization agenda, ISB must modernize itself to evolve with current and future technological and social changes. &#xD;
The Department’s employees are at the centre of this evolution. ISB will continue to invest heavily in staff development and training, enabling staff to change and grow with the environmental changes and to use new and existing skills to drive innovation in the Branch. ISB will also engage new employees with multidisciplinary knowledge and technical specialties to facilitate the horizontal collaboration and partnerships both within and outside of ESDC. This will be critical to its success in identifying new approaches to protect the integrity of its programs, services, people, and assets. </documentation>

      <documentation>ESDC has a mandate to help build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, help Canadians live productive and rewarding lives, and improve Canadians' quality of life. At the heart of this mandate are the policies, programs, services and benefits that support our most vulnerable -- the unemployed, people with disabilities, the homeless and the elderly. Last year alone, Service Canada provided $122 billion in direct benefits to 9.5 million Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
To ensure that ESDC can continue to deliver on this important mandate in the future, we have embarked on a department-wide transformation to improve the client experience during their journey with Employment Insurance (EI), Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Benefits Delivery Modernization (BDM) Programme is leading this transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
BDM Programme signifies a long-term commitment to modernization. Over the next 10 years, many projects will focus on improving our statutory programs in three key areas.  They are:&#xD;
&#xD;
Service Excellence: we want to deliver an outstanding experience for clients, delivering benefits and services when they need them. We also want an organization that embeds quality and integrity in service design.  &#xD;
Policy Agility: we want to be able to adapt policy rapidly to changing needs and priorities of Canadians and their government.&#xD;
Transformed Organization: we want our workforce to have the authority, skills, tools, and training to make it all happen. &#xD;
&#xD;
The four phases, called tranches, are moving at this deliberate pace to ensure changes are done properly and in an integrated way. It also means we can adjust the plan as we go and keep employees informed and prepared.</documentation>

      <documentation>“Another mechanism that organizations use to bake evolvability into their system architectures is the concept of architectural guardrails. As with their real-world roadside equivalents, software guardrails are designed to keep people from straying into dangerous territory.&#xD;
In real terms, guardrails represent a lightweight governance structure. They document how an organization typically “does” things – and how, by implication, development teams are expected to “do” similar things. For example, a guardrail may document not just the specific availability requirements for a new service, but also how the organization goes about meeting such requirements. Typically, guardrails are used in combination with an external oversight team – be this an architecture board, guild, or program office. Typically, the message from such oversight teams is simple: if you stick to the guardrails, you do not need to justify your architectural choices – we will just approve them. However, in those situations where you could not abide by a guardrail, then we need to discuss it. If your reasoning is sound, then we may well agree with you and modify our guardrails, but we reserve the right to tell you to change your approach if there was no good reason not to abide by the guardrails.&#xD;
The key to their power is that they are not mandates. They do not impose absolute bans on teams taking different approaches; rather they encourage creativity and collaboration, and encourage the evolution of the governance structure itself.”&#xD;

      <documentation>The purpose of these Guardrails is to promote consistency and provide guidance around the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) across ESDC, and to enable exchange and integration of data between systems, agencies, businesses and citizens.&#xD;
•	Why API First? – APIs are an efficient and secure way to share data and expose functionality between government's digital services. &quot;API First&quot; is a design principle which stipulates that an API is the first interface for a given application; it is the first artefact to be developed over the data layer, and it is self described.&#xD;
•	What's in the API Guardrails? – the ESDC API Guidelines provide design and best practices for building interfaces between systems or exposing data for secondary use. Other topics include security, metadata, versioning and management. The guidelines have been developed by ESDC using internal references and a thorough review of several public and private sector leaders.&#xD;
•	When to use the API Guardrails? – most real time data integration requirements are best satisfied through APIs. In general, data sharing and integration also encourage the use of APIs to promote platform independence and loosely coupled service design.&#xD;

      <documentation>Appendix B: Development of EA Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
The development of architecture principles is typically influenced by the following :&#xD;
•	Enterprise mission and plans: The mission, plans, and organizational infrastructure of the enterprise. &#xD;
•	Enterprise strategic initiatives: The characteristics of the enterprise; its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, and its current enterprise-wide initiatives (such as process improvement and quality management). &#xD;
•	External constraints: Market factors (time-to-market imperatives, customer expectations, etc.); existing and potential legislation. &#xD;
•	Current systems and technology: The set of information resources deployed within the enterprise, including systems documentation, equipment inventories, network configuration diagrams, policies, and procedures. &#xD;
•	Emerging industry trends: Predictions about economic, political, technical, and market factors that influence the enterprise environment. &#xD;
&#xD;
The EA Principles are developed by following a systematic process to create, socialize, approve and communicate them to ensure that they will have the desired effect. This process involves the following five key steps :&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 1- Identification of the EA Principles: The EA Principles identified in this document were mostly derived from previous EA Principle documents. The following main sources were consulted and leveraged: &#xD;
•	The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Treasury Board defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	(Draft) DFO-MPO Enterprise Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Correctional Service Canada (CSC) defined Architecture Principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 2- Definition of the EA Principles: Once identified, the principles are further defined along the following five criteria and properly documented to fit ESDC’s business needs. EA Principles should be few in number and future-oriented.&#xD;
•	Understandable: The intention of the principle is clear and unambiguous so that it can be quickly grasped and understood by individuals throughout the organization.&#xD;
•	Robust: The principle will enable good quality decisions about architectures and plans to be made and enforceable policies and standards to be created. Each principle should be sufficiently definitive and precise to support consistent decision-making in complex, potentially controversial situations.&#xD;
•	Complete: Every potentially important principle governing the management of information and technology for the organization is defined. The principles cover every situation perceived.&#xD;
•	Consistent: Strict adherence to one principle may require a loose interpretation of another principle. The set of principles must be expressed in a way that allows a balance of interpretations. &#xD;
•	Stable: Principles should be enduring, yet able to accommodate change. An amendment process should be established for adding, removing, or altering principles after they are initially ratified.&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 3 – Revision of EA Principles: Architects within EA/IM Directorate are initially engaged to review and revise the proposed EA Principles. Following that initial revision, some additional key stakeholders could also be engaged in the revision as required. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 4 – Governance and Communication: Once the revision is completed and the EA Principles are agreed upon, they will be governed, endorsed and communicated within ESDC. Senior management will then champion the EA Principles. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 5 – Leveraging the EA principles: The EA Principles will be used as an important tool for Departmental governance within the Gating process of any technology projects. They provide a firm foundation for making architecture and planning decisions, framing policies, procedures and standards, and supporting resolution of contradictory situations.</documentation>

      <documentation>The purpose of these Guardrails is to promote consistency and provide guidance around the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) across ESDC, and to enable exchange and integration of data between systems, agencies, businesses and citizens.&#xD;
•	Why API First? – APIs are an efficient and secure way to share data and expose functionality between government's digital services. &quot;API First&quot; is a design principle which stipulates that an API is the first interface for a given application; it is the first artefact to be developed over the data layer, and it is self described.&#xD;
•	What's in the API Guardrails? – the ESDC API Guidelines provide design and best practices for building interfaces between systems or exposing data for secondary use. Other topics include security, metadata, versioning and management. The guidelines have been developed by ESDC using internal references and a thorough review of several public and private sector leaders.&#xD;
•	When to use the API Guardrails? – most real time data integration requirements are best satisfied through APIs. In general, data sharing and integration also encourage the use of APIs to promote platform independence and loosely coupled service design.&#xD;

      <documentation>The purpose of these Guardrails is to promote consistency and provide guidance around the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) across ESDC, and to enable exchange and integration of data between systems, agencies, businesses and citizens.&#xD;
•	Why API First? – APIs are an efficient and secure way to share data and expose functionality between government's digital services. &quot;API First&quot; is a design principle which stipulates that an API is the first interface for a given application; it is the first artefact to be developed over the data layer, and it is self described.&#xD;
•	What's in the API Guardrails? – the ESDC API Guidelines provide design and best practices for building interfaces between systems or exposing data for secondary use. Other topics include security, metadata, versioning and management. The guidelines have been developed by ESDC using internal references and a thorough review of several public and private sector leaders.&#xD;
•	When to use the API Guardrails? – most real time data integration requirements are best satisfied through APIs. In general, data sharing and integration also encourage the use of APIs to promote platform independence and loosely coupled service design.&#xD;

      <documentation>Data Encoding&#xD;
Digital computer data consists of sequences of zeros and ones. A data encoding standard states how data values such as numbers, text strings, and images should be represented as sequences of zeros and ones, and how such a sequence should be parsed to create data values; for example, ISO®/IEC® 10646:2020: Information Technology – Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) (see References) states how text characters are represented as sequences of zeros and ones in various formats, including UTF-8.&#xD;
A list of media types (formerly known as Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types) that includes the data decoding standards in common use is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).1 These standards are not listed here. The reader should consult the IANA media type registries.&#xD;
Some data encoding standards also define content display or data structure. The media type standards listed by IANA include content display standards and data structure standards as well as data encoding standards.</documentation>

A content display standard states how human-readable content should be represented by data values (and therefore, in conjunction with a data encoding standard, as binary zeros and ones).&#xD;
The most common content display conventions are not formally standardized; for example, conventional English text consists of words, sentences, and paragraphs delimited by spaces and punctuation marks.&#xD;

Under Relational Data:&#xD;
Spreadsheets&#xD;
A convention is sometimes used in spreadsheets and CSV files that one row (the header row) contains the names of the columns, and the cells beneath it contain the values. When a spreadsheet or CSV file has consistently-typed columns (so that it is like a relational database table) the ISO/IEC 11179 standard could apply to its semantics.</documentation>

      <documentation>Metadata Registries&#xD;
International Standard ISO/IEC 11179-1: 2015: Information Technology – Metadata Registries (MDR) – Part 1: Framework (see References) defines a framework for data semantics that is in practice used in connection with relational databases, but in theory could be applied more widely.&#xD;
In this framework, data encodes information about real-world objects and their properties. A data element is a unit of data that is considered in context to be indivisible. It is a logical specification to which a data value can conform, and that states what a conforming data value means. The meaning of a data element value is a combination of an object class and a property, such as person and name. A data element also has a value domain – its set of permissible values.&#xD;
When ISO/IEC 11179 is applied to a relational database, each table represents an object class, each column represents a data element, and each row represents an object and contains the values of the column data elements for that object.&#xD;
Usually, the table names and column names suggest the meaning of the data in a relational database. Formal documentation can describe the meaning more rigorously. Such documentation is a kind of metadata. ISO/IEC 11179 documents the standardization and registration of metadata to make data understandable and shareable.</documentation>

      <documentation>O-DEF™ Standard&#xD;
The Open Data Element Framework (O-DEF) (see References) is a standard of The Open Group based on ISO/IEC 11179 that defines a framework for describing common data element concepts, with an initial index (to be extended over time) of object classes, properties, and roles. (A data element concept is a generic data element, with an object class and property, but no defined value domain.)&#xD;
The O-DEF Standard aids interoperability by enabling basic units of data to be classified, using specific object class and property codes, so that equivalences and similarities between the data can be easily determined.&#xD;
The O-DEF Standard also incorporates codes from existing international standards that can become plug-ins; for example, the product codes in the O-DEF Standard are drawn from the UNSPSC.</documentation>

Entity-Relationship-Attribute (ERA) models are often used to describe relational database structures. ERA modeling is a well-established practice. There is no formal standard for it, although ISO/IEC 11179 defines some modeling terms.</documentation>

      <documentation>Standard Data Models&#xD;
A standard data model13 or Industry Standard Data Model (ISDM) is a data model that is widely applied in some industry, and shared amongst competitors to some degree. There are a number of standard data models, defined by industry bodies, vendors, and others. Many use ERA modeling notations to describe relational structures. Others take the form of hierarchical vocabularies. A particularly extensive standard data model is the US National Information Exchange Model™ (NIEM™).14 The NIEM model includes core elements and elements specific to particular communities.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessObject" name="RDF Triple Stores" id="id-7ca456bf7b824252a37940a3c364a5fb">
      <documentation>RDF Triple Stores&#xD;
In the RDF, the subject of a triple represents a real-world object, the triple’s verb represents a property, and the triple’s object represents the value of the property for the subject. This value can be a real-world object or a data value such as a number, a text string, or an image.&#xD;
Real-world objects and properties that are triple subjects, verbs, and objects are identified by Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI).15 An IRI can be a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that gives the location of a web page, so that the value representing the object or property points to a web page that describes it.16&#xD;
The RDF Schema (RDFS)17 standard defines the meaning of object class and property for the RDF. Fundamentally, this is not very different to what is meant in ISO/IEC 11179. The Web Ontology Language (OWL)18 is a standard language, based on RDF, for defining ontologies. An ontology describes object classes and properties, and relationships between them. An OWL ontology can be a powerful collection of metadata.&#xD;
RDF, RDFS, and OWL can be used to define standard vocabularies, including the examples given in Table 12.&#xD;

Data described using JSON corresponds to a collection of objects, each of which has attributes, each of which is a data value, an object, or an array of objects.&#xD;
There are no formal semantic standards for JSON or YAML, but data described by these languages includes the names of the objects and properties and so, to some extent, is semantically “self-documenting”.</documentation>

Each XML element represents an object, and its attributes are typed data entities that are the values of properties. The content of an element includes child elements that can be regarded as objects that are the values of other properties. As with the names of tables and columns in a relational database schema, the names of elements and attributes in a DTD or XML Schema Definition (XSD) imply some correspondence with the real world.&#xD;
An approach to XML semantics was proposed in the W3C in 2001,19 but this appears not to have resulted in a formal standard.&#xD;

      <documentation>Machine Learning&#xD;
With programs such as UNIX sed and implementations of XSLT, the analysis or transformation is defined by a fixed specification, such as a sed script or transformation template, which is interpreted by an application-agnostic program. In an ML system, the definition of the analysis or transformation is modified in the light of results; the system learns what it has to do. ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can be used for data analysis and transformation.&#xD;
A particular form of data analysis that is relevant to data integration is the analysis of human-readable content. This is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It includes Sentiment Analysis, which assesses whether a piece of human-readable content is positively or negatively disposed towards a product or proposition.&#xD;

This section is normative.&#xD;
&#xD;
This appendix contains definitions for all of the significant/important/unfamiliar terms used in the normative parts of this standard, including terms used in the Conformance section. Please consult http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/ for more information on the role of definitions in standards quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
accessibility problems&#xD;
ATAG 2.0 recognizes two types of accessibility problems:&#xD;
authoring tool user interface accessibility problems: Aspects of an authoring tool user interface that does not meet a success criterion in Part A of ATAG 2.0.&#xD;
web content accessibility problems (WCAG): Aspects of web content that does not meet a WCAG 2.0 success criterion (Level A, AA or AAA).&#xD;
accessibility information (WCAG)&#xD;
Information that web content must contain in order to meet a WCAG 2.0 success criterion (Level A, AA or AAA). Examples include: programmatically associated alternative content (e.g. text alternatives for images), role, and state information for widgets, relationships within complex tables).&#xD;
Note: For the purposes of ATAG 2.0, only programmatically determinable accessibility information qualifies. For additional examples, see Appendix A of the Implementing ATAG 2.0 document.&#xD;
accessible content support features&#xD;
Any features of an authoring tool that directly support authors in increasing the accessibility of the web content being edited. These are features that must be present to meet the success criteria in Part B of ATAG 2.0.&#xD;
alternative content&#xD;
Web content that is used in place of other content that some people are not able to access. Alternative content fulfills essentially the same function or purpose as the original content. WCAG 2.0 recognizes several general types of alternative content:&#xD;
text alternatives for non-text content: Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. For example, an image of a chart might have two text alternatives: a description in the paragraph after the chart and a short text alternative for the chart indicating in words that a description follows.&#xD;
alternatives for time-based media: Web content that serves the same function or purpose as one or more tracks in a time-based media presentation. This includes: captions, audio descriptions, extended audio descriptions, sign language interpretation as well as correctly sequenced text descriptions of time-based visual and auditory information that also is capable of achieving the outcomes of any interactivity in the time-based presentation.&#xD;
media alternative for text: Media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly or via text alternatives). A media alternative for text is provided for people who benefit from alternate representations of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language video), or audio-video.&#xD;
Importantly, from the perspective of authoring tools, alternative content may or may not be:&#xD;
programmatically associated alternative content: Alternative content whose location and purpose can be programmatically determined from the original content for which it is serving as an alternative. For example, a paragraph might serve as a text alternative for an image, but it is only programmatically associated if this relationship is properly encoded (e.g. by &quot;aria-labeledby&quot;).&#xD;
Note: ATAG 2.0 typically refers to programmatically associated alternative content.&#xD;
assistive technology&#xD;
Software (or hardware), separate from the authoring tool, that provides functionality to meet the requirements of people with disabilities (authors and end users). Some authoring tools may also provide direct accessibility features. Examples include:&#xD;
screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual, and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;&#xD;
screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or Braille;&#xD;
text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;&#xD;
speech recognition software, which are used by some people who have some physical disabilities;&#xD;
alternative keyboards, which are used by some people with physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff, and other special input devices);&#xD;
alternative pointing devices, which are used by some people with physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.&#xD;
audio&#xD;
The technology of sound reproduction. Audio can be created synthetically (including speech synthesis), recorded from real-world sounds, or both.&#xD;
author actions preventing generation of accessible web content&#xD;
When the actions of authors prevent authoring tools from generating accessible web content (WCAG). Examples include: turning off accessible content support features, ignoring prompts for accessibility information (WCAG), providing faulty accessibility information (WCAG) at prompts, modifying the authoring tool (e.g. via scripting, macros), and installing plug-ins.&#xD;
authors&#xD;
People who use authoring tools to create or modify web content. The term may cover roles such as content authors, designers, programmers, publishers, testers, etc. (see Part B Conformance Applicability Note 6: Multiple authoring roles). Some authoring tools control who may be an author by managing author permissions.&#xD;
author permission&#xD;
Authorization that allows modification of given web content.&#xD;
authoring action&#xD;
Any action that authors can take using the authoring tool user interface that results in editing web content (e.g. typing text, deleting, inserting an element, applying a template). In contrast, most authoring tool user interfaces also enable actions that do not edit content (e.g. saving, publishing, setting preferences, viewing documentation).&#xD;
reversible authoring action: An authoring action that can be immediately and completely undone by the authoring tool upon a cancel request by an author. Examples of cancel requests include: &quot;cancel&quot;, &quot;undo&quot;, &quot;redo&quot; (when it used to reverse &quot;undo&quot;), &quot;revert&quot;, and &quot;roll-back&quot;&#xD;
Note: It is acceptable for an authoring tool to collect a series of text entry actions (e.g. typed words, a series of backspaces) into a single reversible authoring action.&#xD;
authoring outcome&#xD;
The content or content modifications that result from authoring actions. Authoring outcomes are cumulative (e.g. text is entered, then styled, then made into a link, then given a title).&#xD;
authoring practice&#xD;
An approach that authors follow to achieve a given authoring outcome (e.g. controlling presentation with style sheets). Depending on the design of an authoring tool, authoring practices may be chosen by authors or by the authoring tool. Authoring practices may or may not be:&#xD;
accessible authoring practices (WCAG): An authoring practice in which the authoring outcome conforms to WCAG 2.0 at Level A, AA, or AAA. Some accessible authoring practices require accessibility information (WCAG).&#xD;
authoring session&#xD;
A state of the authoring tool in which web content can be edited by an author.&#xD;
end of an authoring session: The point at which the author has no further opportunity to make authoring actions without starting another session. The end of an authoring session may be determined by authors (e.g. closing a document, publishing) or by the authoring tool (e.g. when the authoring tool transfers editing permission to another author on a collaborative system).&#xD;
Note: The end of the authoring session is distinct from publishing. Automatic content generation may continue after the end of both the authoring session and initial publishing (e.g. content management system updates).&#xD;
authoring tool&#xD;
Any web-based or non-web-based application(s) that can be used by authors (alone or collaboratively) to create or modify web content for use by other people (other authors or end users).&#xD;
Note 1: &quot;application(s)&quot;: ATAG 2.0 may be conformed to by stand-alone applications or by collections of applications. If a conformance claim is made, then the claim must provide identifying information for each application and also for any required extensions, plug-ins, etc.&#xD;
Note 2: &quot;alone or collaboratively&quot;: Multiple authors may contribute to the creation of web content and, depending on the authoring tool, each author may work with different views of the content and different author permissions.&#xD;
Note 3: &quot;to create or modify web content&quot;: This clause rules out software that collects data from a person for other purposes (e.g. online grocery order form) and then creates web content from that data (e.g. a web-based warehouse order) without informing the person (however, WCAG 2.0 would still apply). This clause also rules out software used to create content exclusively in non-web content technologies.&#xD;
Note 4: &quot;for use by other people&quot;: This clause rules out the many web applications that allow people to modify web content that only they themselves experience (e.g. web-based email display settings) or that only provide input to automated processes (e.g. library catalog search page).&#xD;
Examples of software that are generally considered authoring tools under ATAG 2.0:&#xD;
web page authoring tools (e.g. WYSIWYG HTML editors)&#xD;
software for directly editing source code&#xD;
software for converting to web content technologies (e.g. &quot;Save as HTML&quot; features in office document applications)&#xD;
integrated development environments (e.g. for web application development)&#xD;
software that generates web content on the basis of templates, scripts, command-line input or &quot;wizard&quot;-type processes&#xD;
software for rapidly updating portions of web pages (e.g. blogging, wikis, online forums)&#xD;
software for generating/managing entire websites (e.g. content management systems, courseware tools, content aggregators)&#xD;
email clients that send messages using web content technologies&#xD;
multimedia authoring tools&#xD;
software for creating mobile web applications&#xD;
Examples of software that are not considered authoring tools under ATAG 2.0 (in all cases, WCAG 2.0 still applies if the software is web-based):&#xD;
customizable personal portals: ATAG 2.0 does not apply because the web content being edited is only available to the owner of the portal&#xD;
e-commerce order forms: ATAG 2.0 does not apply because the purpose of an e-commerce order form is to order a product, not communicate with other people via web content, even if the data collected by the form actually does result in web content (e.g. online tracking pages)&#xD;
stand-alone accessibility checkers: ATAG 2.0 does not apply because a stand-alone accessibility checker with no automated or semi-automated repair functionality does not actually modify web content. An accessibility checker with repair functionality or that is considered as part of a larger authoring process would be considered an authoring tool.&#xD;
authoring tool user interface&#xD;
The display and control mechanism that authors use to operate the authoring tool software. User interfaces may be non-web-based or web-based or a combination (e.g. a non-web-based authoring tool might have web-based help pages):&#xD;
authoring tool user interface (non-web-based): Any parts of an authoring tool user interface that are not implemented as web content and instead run directly on a platform that is not a user agent (e.g. Windows, Mac OS, Java Virtual Machine, iOS, Android).&#xD;
authoring tool user interface (web-based): Any parts of an authoring tool user interface that are implemented using web content technologies and are accessed by authors via a user agent.&#xD;
Authoring tool user interfaces may or may not be:&#xD;
accessible authoring tool user interfaces: Authoring tool user interfaces that meet the success criteria of a level in Part A of ATAG 2.0.&#xD;
checking, accessibility&#xD;
The process by which web content is evaluated for web content accessibility problems (WCAG). ATAG 2.0 recognizes three types of checking, based on increasing levels of automation of the tests:&#xD;
manual checking: Checking in which the tests are carried out by authors. This includes the case where authors are aided by instructions or guidance provided by the authoring tool, but where authors must carry out the actual test procedure.&#xD;
semi-automated checking: Checking in which the tests are partially carried out by the authoring tool, but where authors' input or judgment is still required to decide or help decide the outcome of the tests.&#xD;
automated checking: Checking in which the tests are carried out automatically by the authoring tool without any intervention by authors.&#xD;
An authoring tool may support any combination of checking types.&#xD;
content (web content)&#xD;
Information and sensory experience to be communicated to the end user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions. In ATAG 2.0, the term is primarily used to refer to the output that is produced by the authoring tool. Content produced by authoring tools may include web applications, including those that act as web-based authoring tools. Content may or may not be:&#xD;
accessible content (WCAG): Content that would conform to WCAG 2.0, at either Level A, AA, or AAA, assuming that any web content technologies relied upon to satisfy the WCAG 2.0 success criteria are accessibility supported.&#xD;
Note 1: If accessibility support for the relied upon technologies is lacking, then the content will not conform to WCAG 2.0 and one or more groups of end users with disabilities will likely experience difficulty accessing the content.&#xD;
Note 2: Conformance to WCAG 2.0, even at the highest level (i.e. Level AAA), still may not make content &quot;accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability&quot;.&#xD;
content being edited: The web content that an author can modify during an authoring session. The content being edited may be a complete piece of content (e.g. image, style sheet) or only part of a larger piece of content (e.g. a status update). The content being edited only includes content in web content technologies that the authoring tool supports (e.g. a WYSIWYG HTML editor allows editing of the HTML content of a web page editable, but not the images).&#xD;
content properties&#xD;
The individual pieces of information that make up the web content (e.g. the attributes and contents of elements, style sheet information).&#xD;
content (structured)&#xD;
Web content that includes machine-readable internal structure (e.g. markup elements), as opposed to unstructured content, such as raster image formats or plain human language text.&#xD;
content generation (content authoring, content editing)&#xD;
The act of specifying the actual web content that will be rendered, played or executed by the end user's user agent. While the precise details of how content is created in any given system may vary widely, responsibility for the generation of content can be any combination of the following:&#xD;
author generated content: Web content for which authors are fully responsible. The author may only be responsible down to a particular level (e.g. when asked to type a text label, the author is responsible for the text, but not for how the label is marked up; when typing markup in a source editing-view, the author is not responsible for the fact that UNICODE is used to encode the text ).&#xD;
automatically-generated content: Web content for which developer-programmed functionality is fully responsible (e.g. what markup to output when an author requests to start a new document, automatically correcting markup errors).&#xD;
third-party content generation: Web content for which a third-party author is responsible (e.g. community shared templates).&#xD;
content rendering&#xD;
User interface functionality that authoring tools present if they render, play or execute the web content being edited. ATAG 2.0 recognizes several types of content renderings:&#xD;
conventional renderings (or &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;): When content is rendered in a way that is similar to the default rendering a user agent would create from the same content. While &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;, standing for &quot;What-you-see-is-what-you-get&quot; is the common term, differences between user agents and end user settings mean that in reality there is no single typical end user experience; or&#xD;
unconventional renderings: When content is rendered differently than it would be in a typical user agent (e.g. rendering an audio file as a graphical waveform); or&#xD;
partial renderings: When some aspects of the content are rendered, played, or executed, but not others (e.g. a frame-by-frame video editor renders the graphical, but not the timing aspects, of a video).&#xD;
content transformations&#xD;
Processes that take content in one web content technology or non-web content technology (e.g. a word processing format) as input and produce content that has been optimized, restructured or recoded:&#xD;
Optimizing Content Transformations: Transformations in which the content technology is not changed and the structural features of the content technology that are employed also stay the same. Changes would not be expected to result in information loss (e.g. removing whitespace, replacing in-line styles with an external style sheet).&#xD;
Restructuring Content Transformations: Transformations in which the content technology stays the same, but the structural features of the technology used to markup the content are changed (e.g. linearizing tables, splitting a document into pages.&#xD;
Recoding Content Transformations: Transformations in which the content technology used to encode the content is changed (e.g. HTML to XHTML, a word processing format to HTML).&#xD;
Note: Clipboard operations, in which content is copied to or pasted from the platform clipboard, are not considered content transformations.&#xD;
control settings&#xD;
Settings that relate to how authors operate the authoring tool, for example using the keyboard or mouse.&#xD;
developer&#xD;
Any entities or individuals responsible for programming the authoring tool. This includes the programmers of any additional software components included by the Claimant in the conformance claim. In some cases, development of the authoring tool is complete before authors can use it to publish web content. However, in other cases (e.g. some web-based authoring tools), the developer may continue to modify the authoring tool even after content has been published, such that the content experienced by the end user is modified.&#xD;
direct accessibility features&#xD;
Features of an authoring tool that provide functionality to meet the requirements of authors with disabilities (e.g. keyboard navigation, zoom features, text-to-speech). Additional or specialized functionality may still be provided by external assistive technology.&#xD;
display settings&#xD;
Settings that relate to how authors perceive the authoring tool. These include:&#xD;
audio display settings: the characteristics of audio output of music, sounds, and speech. Examples include volume, speech voices, voice speed, and voice emphasis.&#xD;
visual display settings: the characteristics of the on-screen rendering of text and graphics. Examples include fonts, sizes, colors, spacing, positioning, and contrast.&#xD;
tactile display settings: the characteristics of haptic output. Examples include the magnitude of the haptic forces and the types of vibration.&#xD;
documentation&#xD;
Any information that supports the use of an authoring tool. This information may be provided electronically or otherwise and includes help, manuals, installation instructions, sample work flows, tutorials, etc.&#xD;
document object&#xD;
The internal representation of data in the source by a non-web based authoring tool or user agent. The document object may form part of a platform accessibility service that enables communication with assistive technologies. Web-based authoring tools are considered to make use of the document object that is maintained by the user agent.&#xD;
element&#xD;
A pair of markup tags and its content, or an &quot;empty tag&quot; (one that requires no closing tag or content).&#xD;
end user&#xD;
A person who interacts with web content once it has been authored. This includes people using assistive technologies.&#xD;
human language&#xD;
Language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans.&#xD;
informative&#xD;
For information purposes and not required for conformance.&#xD;
keyboard interface&#xD;
Keyboard interfaces are programmatic services provided by many platforms that allow operation in a device independent manner. A keyboard interface can allow keystroke input even if particular devices do not contain a hardware keyboard (e.g. a touchscreen-controlled device can have a keyboard interface built into its operating system to support onscreen keyboards as well as external keyboards that may be connected).&#xD;
Note: Keyboard-operated mouse emulators, such as MouseKeys, do not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because these emulators use pointing device interfaces, not keyboard interfaces.&#xD;
keyboard trap&#xD;
A user interface situation in which a keyboard interface may be used to move focus to, but not from, a user interface component or group of components.&#xD;
label&#xD;
Text or other component with a text alternative that is presented to users to identify a component. A label is presented to all users whereas the name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same.&#xD;
live&#xD;
Information captured from a real-world event that is published with no more than a broadcast delay.&#xD;
Note: A broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order to give the broadcaster time to queue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient to allow significant editing.&#xD;
markup language&#xD;
A system of text annotations (e.g. elements in HTML) and processing rules that may be used to specify the structure, presentation or semantics of content. Examples of markup languages include HTML and SVG.&#xD;
markup of some content is the set of annotations that appear in the content.&#xD;
name&#xD;
Text by which software can identify a user interface component to the author or end user. The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a label is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same.&#xD;
non-text content&#xD;
Any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language. This includes ASCII Art (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, and images representing text.&#xD;
normative&#xD;
Required for conformance. One may conform in a variety of well-defined ways to ATAG 2.0. Content identified as &quot;informative&quot; or &quot;non-normative&quot; is never required for conformance.&#xD;
option&#xD;
When an author is presented with choices.&#xD;
default option: A setting or value for an option that is assigned automatically by the authoring tool and remains in effect unless canceled or changed by the author.&#xD;
platform&#xD;
The software environment within which the authoring tool operates. Platforms provide a consistent operational environment on top of lower level software platforms or hardware. For web-based authoring user interfaces, the most relevant platform will be a user agent (e.g. browser). For non-web-based user interfaces, the range of platforms includes, but may not be limited to, desktop operating systems (e.g. GNOME desktop on Linux, Mac OS, Windows), mobile operating systems (e.g. Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows Phone), or cross-OS environments (e.g. Java), etc.&#xD;
Note 1: Many platforms mediate communication between applications operating on the platform and assistive technology via a platform accessibility service.&#xD;
Note 2: Accessibility guidelines for developers exist for many platforms.&#xD;
platform accessibility service&#xD;
A programmatic interface that is specifically engineered to provide communication between applications and assistive technologies (e.g. MSAA, IAccessible2 and UI Automation for Windows applications, AXAPI for Mac OS X applications, GNOME Accessibility Toolkit API for GNOME applications, Java Access for Java applications). On some platforms, it may be conventional to enhance communication further by implementing a document object.&#xD;
plug-in&#xD;
A program that runs as part of the authoring tool (e.g. a third-party checking and repair tool) and that is not part of web content being edited. Authors generally choose to include or exclude plug-ins from their authoring tool.&#xD;
pre-authored content&#xD;
Pieces of web content, created prior to an authoring session, that the authoring tool developer makes available to authors to use in the content being edited. Examples include clip art, sample videos, user interface widgets.&#xD;
Note 1: For templates, an incomplete form of pre-authored content, see Guideline B.2.4.&#xD;
Note 2: If the authoring tool uses pre-authored content automatically, see Guideline B.1.1.&#xD;
accessible pre-authored content (WCAG): Pre-authored content that is either already accessible web content (WCAG) or would be accessible, if it was appropriately inserted into an empty document.&#xD;
Note: If extensive author input is required to make use of pre-authored content, then the content may in fact be a template.&#xD;
pre-authored content selection mechanism&#xD;
A function beyond standard file selection that allows authors to select pre-authored content to use in an authoring session (e.g. clip art gallery, widget palette).&#xD;
presentation&#xD;
Rendering of the content in a form to be perceived by authors or end users.&#xD;
programmatically determined (programmatically determinable)&#xD;
Information that is encoded in a way that allows different software, including assistive technologies, to extract and present the information in different modalities. ATAG 2.0 uses this term in two contexts:&#xD;
Processing content: Whether the authoring tool is able to extract information from the web content (e.g. to extract the language of content from the markup).&#xD;
Communication between the authoring tool and assistive technology: For non-web-based user interfaces, this means making use of platform accessibility services, APIs, and, in some cases, document object models. For web-based user interfaces, this means ensuring that the user agent can pass on the information (e.g. through the use of WAI-ARIA).&#xD;
prominence&#xD;
A heuristic measure of how likely authors are to notice a user interface component in a user interface that they are operating. Prominence is affected by numerous factors, including: the number of navigation steps required, the reading order position, visual properties (e.g. size, spacing, color), and even the modality of use (e.g. mouse vs. keyboard use).&#xD;
at least as prominent: For ATAG 2.0, a user interface component A is considered to be &quot;at least as prominent&quot; as another component B when, from a default state, component A becomes displayed (and enabled) with the same number or less &quot;opening&quot; actions than are required for component B to become displayed (and enabled).&#xD;
Note 1: When a container is open, all of the enabled components in the container (e.g. items in a list, items in a menu, buttons in a toolbar, all components in a dialog box) are considered to be displayed (and therefore are at least as prominent as each other), even if the container must be scrolled for them to become visible. This takes into account that different screen sizes and author settings will affect which components are visible at a given time.&#xD;
Note 2: &quot;Opening actions&quot; are actions made by authors on components within the user interface that result in new components becoming displayed or enabled. For example: (a) keyboard shortcut to a top-level menu item to display a sub-menu, (b) keyboard selection on a button to display a dialog box, (c) mouse click on a checkbox to enable previously disabled sub-items, etc. Actions that do not cause new components to become actionable (e.g. moving focus, scrolling a list), are not counted as &quot;opening actions&quot;.&#xD;
Note 3: Keyboard shortcuts to components in closed containers are not counted as &quot;opening actions&quot; because the components have no prominence when they are not displayed. The same is true when authors must use &quot;search&quot; to reveal components in closed containers.&#xD;
Note 4: The &quot;default state&quot; is the state of the authoring tool at the beginning of an authoring session as set by the developer. The default state of many document authoring tools is an editing-view.&#xD;
prompt&#xD;
Any authoring tool initiated request for a decision or piece of information from authors. The term covers both requests that must be responded to immediately (e.g. modal dialog boxes) as well as less urgent requests (e.g. underlining a misspelled word).&#xD;
publishing&#xD;
Any point at which the authors or authoring tool make web content available to end users (e.g. uploading a web page, committing a change in a wiki, live streaming).&#xD;
range&#xD;
More than one item within a multi-item set.&#xD;
Informative Note: ATAG 2.0 uses the term &quot;range&quot; where absolute measurements may not be practical (e.g. the set of all help documentation examples, the set of all templates). While the strict testable requirement is the definition &quot;More than one item within a multi-item set&quot;, implementers are strongly encouraged to implement the success criteria more broadly.&#xD;
relationships&#xD;
Meaningful associations between distinct pieces of content.&#xD;
repair (accessibility)&#xD;
The process by which web content accessibility problems that have been identified within web content are resolved. ATAG 2.0 recognizes three types of repair, based on increasing levels of automation:&#xD;
manual repair: Where the repairs are carried out by authors. This includes the case where authors are aided by instructions or guidance provided by the authoring tool, but where authors carry out the actual repair procedure;&#xD;
semi-automated repair: Where the repairs are partially carried out by the authoring tool, but where authors' input or judgment is still required to complete the repair; and&#xD;
automated repair: Where the repairs are carried out automatically by the authoring tool without any intervention by authors.&#xD;
restrictions, restricted web content authoring&#xD;
When the web content that authors can specify with an authoring tool either must include or must not include certain content (e.g. elements, attributes, widgets). Many authoring tools restrict authoring in some way, which can either benefit accessibility (e.g. if text alternatives for non-text content are required) or detract from accessibility (e.g. if attributes for defining text alternatives are not available). In contrast, authoring tools that allow unrestricted web content authoring do not require any particular content to be included or not included (e.g. many source editing-views).&#xD;
role&#xD;
Text or a number by which software can identify the function of a component within web content (e.g. a string that indicates whether an image functions as a hyperlink, command button, or check box).&#xD;
sequential keyboard access&#xD;
Using a keyboard interface to navigate the focus one-by-one through all of the items in an ordered set (e.g. menu items, form fields) until the desired item is reached and activated. This is in contrast to direct keyboard access methods such as keyboard shortcuts and the use of bypass links.&#xD;
technology (web content)&#xD;
A mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents. Web content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end user experiences that range from static web pages to multimedia presentations to dynamic web applications. Some common examples of web content technologies include HTML, CSS, SVG, PNG, PDF, Flash, Silverlight, Flex, and JavaScript.&#xD;
template&#xD;
Content patterns that are filled in by authors or the authoring tool to produce web content for end users (e.g. document templates, content management templates, presentation themes). Often templates will pre-specify at least some authoring decisions.&#xD;
accessible templates (WCAG): Templates that can be filled in to create web content that meets the WCAG 2.0 success criteria (Level A, AA or AAA), when both of the following are true:&#xD;
The author correctly follows any instructions provided (e.g. correctly responding to prompts, correctly replacing highlighted placeholders); and&#xD;
No further authoring occurs&#xD;
Note: Under these conditions, some templates will result in completely empty documents, which are considered accessible by default.&#xD;
template selection mechanism&#xD;
A function beyond standard file selection that allows authors to select templates to use as the basis for new content or to apply to existing content.&#xD;
time limit&#xD;
The amount of time that an authoring tool provides to authors to perform a task (e.g. read a message, select an item, save a change). Examples include: authoring session timeouts, time-based presentations (e.g. tutorial video).&#xD;
tutorial&#xD;
A type of documentation that provides step-by-step instructions for performing multi-part tasks.&#xD;
user agent&#xD;
Any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end user interaction with web content (e.g. web browsers, browser plug-ins, media players)&#xD;
In-Market User Agent: A user agent that can be procured by members of the public (free or otherwise). Usually, an in-market user agent will be a separate software from the authoring tool; however, sometimes a software may combine user agent and authoring tool functionality. These cases include:&#xD;
Preview-Only: If the user agent can only render web content that it receives from the associated authoring functionality, then the software is an authoring tool with a preview feature. Such preview-only features are not considered in-market user agents.&#xD;
User Agent with Authoring Tool Mode: If the user agent functionality must retrieve and open web content before it can be sent to the authoring tool functionality, then the software is a user agent with an authoring tool mode. If the user agent is used to preview content produced by the authoring tool mode, then it is to be considered an in-market user agent.&#xD;
Combined User Agent/Authoring Tool: A user agent in which the default mode of user interaction enables editing the web content. These tools do not need previews because the author is already experiencing the content in the same way as end users.&#xD;
user interface component&#xD;
A part of the user interface or content display (including content renderings) that is perceived by authors as a single control for a distinct function.&#xD;
video&#xD;
The technology of moving pictures or images. Video can be made up of animated or photographic images, or both.&#xD;
view&#xD;
A user interface function that authors use to interact with the web content being edited. ATAG 2.0 categorizes views according to whether they support editing:&#xD;
editing-views: Views in which some or all of the content is editable; or&#xD;
previews: Views in which no authoring actions are provided (i.e. the view is not editable). Previews are provided to present the web content being edited by the authoring tool as it would appear to end users of user agents. Previews may be implemented using actual in-market user agents, but this is not necessary.&#xD;
ATAG 2.0 also recognizes several approaches to presenting the content in a view:&#xD;
source views: The content is presented in unrendered form (e.g. plain text editors); or&#xD;
rendered views: Content renderings (conventional, unconventional or partial) are presented; or&#xD;
property views: Only properties of the content are presented. The authoring tool then uses these properties to automatically generate the content to be published (e.g. CMS calendar widget that generates a calendar from the numeric month and year).&#xD;
workflow&#xD;
A customary sequence of steps or tasks that authors follow to produce a content deliverable. If an authoring tool is composed of a collection of applications (e.g. markup editor, image editor, and validation tool), then its workflows may include use of one or more of the applications.</documentation>

1.4.3.1.	Data Lake &#xD;
The advent of “big data” tools is enabling organizations to detect patterns in data that may otherwise escape human recognition.  This is being further advanced with new tools in machine learning and artificial intelligence described below.  These tools are designed to access large data sets in a range of native formats, but such access cannot generally target mission critical systems for fear of adverse performance effects.  This long-standing performance issue remains true for supporting more traditional reporting and analytics techniques as well.  To enable state-of-the-art tools to operate, the industry has begun to co-locate large volumes of data in “raw” forms.  Such a repository is called a data lake, and by “raw” form it is meant that few, if any, operations are performed when the data is copied from operational systems into the data lake.  As a result, the data lake contains a complete and detailed copy of the organization’s assets, but stored in a very human-unfriendly form.  This is well suited to support two activities: big-data, machine learning and artificial intelligence operations performed by highly-skilled specialists, and extraction of key data into a data warehouse without interfering with mission critical systems as described below.  In the absence of a data lake, it is not possible to bring to bear many modern technological tools, and consequently there are likely many opportunities to improve service that remain hidden.  There is a business need to provide secure access to authorized users, including executives and analysts, to easy-to-use, reporting, dash-boarding, and visualization tools that require few technical skills and yet provide answers to basic business questions, in near-real-time, in a manner that does not adversely affect performance of operational systems, and enables access to integrated, enterprise-shared data.&#xD;

Initially identified BDM future state capabilities and enablers  will be coordinated synergistically with CDO data foundations.  This will be equally true for other transformation activities.  Table 1 summarizes data relevant BDM capabilities and enablers identified by that program area.</documentation>

      <documentation>•	Enforcement function&#xD;
Currently, the Enforcement division utilizes a SharePoint site developed as a response to the critical shortcomings and abandonment of the Major Investigation and Sensitive Case Information System (MISCIS) as a case management system. MISCIS was an MS-Access database with limited functionality that did not meet business objectives. In addition, this solution had no workflow management and was not designed to be a case management system or a long-term solution to respond to current operational risks. An internal audit conducted by ISB in 2014 outlined the immediate need to develop and implement a robust and comprehensive case management system to manage the increase of enforcement investigations, aligned to key stages of the investigation workflow, and to help provide a framework for the separation of Enforcement and Compliance functions§. The report also highlighted the importance in consistency of evidence building in our processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
§Note: &#xD;
Recommendation 29: Enforcement reviews and replaces the existing case management system (MISCIS) to better meet the needs of the potential future new “Investigations”* function.&#xD;
Recommendation 41: Enforcement segregates sensitive investigations that follow an administrative verification stream from those that follow an “investigation”* stream and be reporting through dedicated but separate National Headquarters (NHQ) functions.&#xD;
*The term “investigation” is used here to describe any investigation with the predominant purpose of determining criminal liability under either ESDC-administered legislation or the Criminal Code of Canada.</documentation>

      <documentation>As new data is imported into the data reservoir, the data ingestion processes ensure the data is transformed, logged, and copied into the appropriate data repositories.&#xD;
The ability to easily import data from a multitude of sources is one of the selling points of the data reservoir. You want to be able to capture anything easily, and to allow decisions about how that data can be used later in the process. That being said, information needs to be incorporated into the reservoir in a controlled manner. During the process, metadata must be captured. It is also important to ensure appropriate separation between other systems and the reservoir to ensure an issue in one does not impact both. The Information Ingestion component is responsible for managing this. A staging area will often be used as part of the process to support loose coupling and ensure that delays in processing will not affect the source system.&#xD;
The information ingestion component will apply appropriate policies to the incoming data, including masking, quality validation, deduplication, and will push appropriate metadata to the reservoir catalog.&#xD;
Data with a known structure can be stored in a more structured repository such as a relational database, whereas less structured or mixed data can end up in a file system such as HDFS.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data scientists usually have a solid foundation in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, rather than substantial business knowledge. Their role is to explore different kinds of data to look at patterns so that they can understand the meaning of relationships between sets of data. They often have a thirst for new information sources to develop new ideas on how to gain value from combining that data with other sources. The tools used by the data scientists include capabilities for preparing and transforming data for analysis. They typically work with data in its original (raw) format. Data can be accessed through the creation of a sandbox copy of the data for the data scientist to use because the data scientist will subset and transform the data as part of their work. Their activity should not affect the shared version of the data in the data reservoir. The sandbox will be accessible as an area in a file system such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or accessible by using common mechanisms such as Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). As the data scientists explore samples of this data, they will develop analytical models and try them out against test data.

      <documentation>Data scientists usually have a solid foundation in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, rather than substantial business knowledge. Their role is to explore different kinds of data to look at patterns so that they can understand the meaning of relationships between sets of data. They often have a thirst for new information sources to develop new ideas on how to gain value from combining that data with other sources. The tools used by the data scientists include capabilities for preparing and transforming data for analysis. They typically work with data in its original (raw) format. Data can be accessed through the creation of a sandbox copy of the data for the data scientist to use because the data scientist will subset and transform the data as part of their work. Their activity should not affect the shared version of the data in the data reservoir. The sandbox will be accessible as an area in a file system such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or accessible by using common mechanisms such as Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). As the data scientists explore samples of this data, they will develop analytical models and try them out against test data. Those models can then be deployed to refinery services within the data reservoir or to operational systems outside the data reservoir.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Fabric&#xD;
A data fabric enables frictionless access and sharing of data in a distributed data environment. It enables a single and consistent data management framework, which allows seamless data access and processing by design across otherwise siloed storage. It may use analytics to constantly monitor data pipelines and support the design, deployment, and utilization of diverse data. Gartner® Data and Analysis Trends, 2021 (see References) claim that this can reduce time for integration by 30%, deployment by 30%, and maintenance by 70%.&#xD;
A data fabric has an application interface, and often also a user interface. It gives the ability to write data, as well as to read it. The sources may be on-premise or in the cloud. Data fabrics deliver a unified, intelligent, and integrated end-to-end platform to support data use-cases. They provide the ability to deliver use-cases quickly by leveraging innovation in dynamic integration, distributed, and multi-cloud architectures, graph engines, and distributed in-memory and persistent memory platforms. Data fabric focuses on automating the process integration, transformation, preparation, curation, security, governance, and orchestration to enable analytics and insights quickly for business success. It minimizes complexity by automating processes, workflows, and pipelines, generating code, and streamlining data to accelerate various use-cases.&#xD;
An application can read data from or update data in multiple sources, describing the data in terms of a common data model. The read and update requests are converted by data platforms to requests that describe the data in terms of the source data models. The data is then obtained from the sources and integrated, or updated in the sources, by continual synchronization or dynamic query.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Mesh&#xD;
The concept of data mesh is related but slightly different to that of data fabric. A data mesh consists of data products, each of which meets a set of user needs and has assured levels of quality and security. A data product is a computing unit that includes data, code, and metadata, and uses a data platform. (A data platform can be shared by multiple data products.)&#xD;
A data mesh has domain-oriented, decentralized data ownership and management. It does not necessarily provide uniform access to the data, but the data products of a mesh can be exposed by data platforms as sources in a data fabric.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Node" name="Data Platforms" id="id-0fa20dbdbbdc4921b005912e20203357">
      <documentation>Data Platforms&#xD;
Data platforms are architecture components that connect to multiple sources and provide access to their data. They are key components of data fabrics and data meshes. They may import data from the sources but more usually, and more effectively, they use data virtualization. In either case, they transform the source data to fit a target schema, or expose the source schema to applications.&#xD;
Figure 3 shows how data platforms enable applications to access data. They may communicate with each other or use common metadata to make the access uniform.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Protecting Canadians From COVID-19" id="id-99a1db3b02574ebdbb0b1edfbe0d3178">
      <documentation>The first foundation of the Government’s approach is protecting Canadians from COVID-19.&#xD;
This is priority number one.&#xD;
It is the job of the federal government to look out for all Canadians and especially our most vulnerable. We need to work together. Beating this virus is a Team Canada effort.&#xD;
Over the last six months, Canadians have stood united and strong. Their actions embody what has always been the purpose of the federal government: bringing Canadians together to achieve common goals.&#xD;
Personal protective equipment has been shipped across the country. Members of the Canadian Forces were there in long-term care homes. Close to 9 million Canadians were helped with the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and over 3.5 million jobs were supported by the wage subsidy.&#xD;
The Government will continue to have people’s backs just like Canadians have each other’s backs.&#xD;
Through the first wave, contact tracing and testing ramped up across the country. The surge this fall further reinforces what we already know – that we must do even more.&#xD;
The federal government will be there to help the provinces increase their testing capacity. Canadians should not be waiting in line for hours to get a test.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government is pursuing every technology and every option for faster tests for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. As soon as tests are approved for safe use in Canada, the Government will do everything it can to see them deployed. The Government will also create a federal Testing Assistance Response Team to quickly meet surge testing needs, including in remote and isolated communities.&#xD;
Local public health authorities are the backbone of our nation’s efforts to stop outbreaks before they start. As members of the communities they protect, they know the devastating economic impact a lockdown order can have.&#xD;
To prevent small clusters from becoming major outbreaks, communities may need to enact short-term closure orders. To make that decision easier for the public health authorities, and to help ease the impact that science- and evidence-based decisions can have on local businesses in the short term, the Government will work to target additional financial support directly to businesses which have to temporarily shut down as a result of a local public health decision.&#xD;
This will ensure that decisions are made with the health of Canadians as the first priority.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to work on what communities need more broadly.&#xD;
The Government has already invested over $19 billion for a Safe Restart Agreement with provinces and territories, to support everything from the capacity of health care systems to securing PPE.&#xD;
To address the challenges faced by provinces and territories as they reopen classrooms, the federal government invested $2 billion in the Safe Return to Class Fund, along with new funding for First Nations communities. This is money to keep kids – and staff – safe in the classroom, whether that’s by helping schools buy cleaning supplies or upgrade ventilation.&#xD;
These commitments build on federal investments to support people who are most at risk and those who care for them, including with the federal wage top-up for personal support workers. People on the frontlines who have been looking after seniors do vital work and the Government will continue to have their backs.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will continue to support Canadians as they take action to keep each other safe.&#xD;
Already, people are doing their part by wearing masks. That’s important, and we can build on that commitment. Working with private sector partners, the federal government created the COVID Alert app. Canadians living in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan now have an extra tool to keep themselves and others safe. The Government hopes all the others will sign on so that people in all parts of the country can both do their part and be better protected.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to work on getting Canadians the PPE they need.&#xD;
This spring, the Government issued a call, and thousands of Canadian businesses and manufacturers responded. From shop floors to companies big and small, Canada’s dynamic businesses met the challenge as their workers stepped up. &#xD;
And in less than six months, Canadians are now manufacturing almost all types of PPE. The Government will continue building that domestic capacity, while securing supply chains to keep Canadians safe and create jobs.&#xD;
Canadians are pulling together, whether that’s with PPE manufacturing, through the COVID Alert app, or by wearing a mask. In the same way, Canadian researchers and scientists are pitching in to the Team Canada effort with their knowledge and expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
VACCINE EFFORTS&#xD;
In the long run, the best way to end this pandemic is with a safe and effective vaccine.&#xD;
Canada’s vaccine strategy is all about ensuring that Canadians will be able to get a vaccine once it is ready.&#xD;
There are many types of potential candidates. Canada is exploring the full range of options. The Government has already secured access to vaccine candidates and therapeutics, while investing in manufacturing here at home. And to get the vaccines out to Canadians once they’re ready, the Government has made further investments in our capacity for vaccine distribution.&#xD;
From the Vaccine Task Force that provides the best advice on vaccine purchasing and roll-out, to the Immunity Task Force looking at how COVID-19 is affecting vulnerable populations, Canada’s top scientific minds are guiding the Government every step of the way.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Helping Canadians Through The Pandemic" id="id-87c32693e7634b01b49d4013e098996d">
      <documentation>The medical and scientific fight against this virus is crucial. And so are the livelihoods of every single Canadian, worker, and family.&#xD;
So the second foundation of the Government’s approach is supporting Canadians through this crisis.&#xD;
The economic impact of COVID-19 on Canadians has already been worse than the 2008 financial crisis. These consequences will not be short-lived.&#xD;
This is not the time for austerity. Canada entered this crisis in the best fiscal position of its peers. And the Government is using that fiscal firepower, on things like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, so that Canadians, businesses, and our entire economy have the support needed to weather the storm.&#xD;
Canadians should not have to choose between health and their job, just like Canadians should not have to take on debt that their government can better shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
CREATING JOBS&#xD;
People losing their jobs is perhaps the clearest consequence of the global economic shock that Canadians – like those in other countries – have faced.&#xD;
The CERB helped people stay healthy at home while being able to keep food on the table.&#xD;
The CEWS helped people keep their jobs, or be rehired if they had been laid off.&#xD;
But there is still more to be done.&#xD;
Unemployment is in the double digits, and underemployment is high.&#xD;
Women, racialized Canadians, and young people have borne the brunt of job losses.&#xD;
Canadians need good jobs they can rely on.&#xD;
To help make that happen, the Government will launch a campaign to create over one million jobs, restoring employment to previous levels. This will be done by using a range of tools, including direct investments in the social sector and infrastructure, immediate training to quickly skill up workers, and incentives for employers to hire and retain workers.&#xD;
One way the Government will create these jobs is by extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy right through to next summer. The Government will work with businesses and labour to ensure the program meets the needs of the health and economic situation as it evolves.&#xD;
Another example of how the Government will create jobs is by significantly scaling up the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, to provide more paid work experiences next year for young Canadians.&#xD;
Now, more than ever, Canadians must work together – including by eliminating remaining barriers between provinces to full, free internal trade – to get the economy back up and running and Canadians back to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUPPORTING WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES&#xD;
With the job losses that Canadians have faced, it became clear early on that many people would need help until they could find work once again. But existing income support systems were not designed to handle this unprecedented situation. That’s why the Government moved quickly to create the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as a temporary program to help millions of Canadians get through a very difficult time.&#xD;
With the economic restart now well underway, CERB recipients should instead be supported by the Employment Insurance system. For people who would not traditionally qualify for EI, the Government will create the transitional Canada Recovery Benefit.&#xD;
Over the coming months, the EI system will become the sole delivery mechanism for employment benefits, including for Canadians who did not qualify for EI before the pandemic. This pandemic has shown that Canada needs an EI system for the 21st century, including for the self-employed and those in the gig economy. &#xD;
&#xD;
WOMEN IN THE ECONOMY&#xD;
Women – and in particular low-income women – have been hit hardest by COVID-19. This crisis has been described as a She-cession.&#xD;
Many women have bravely served on the frontlines of this crisis, in our communities or by shouldering the burden of unpaid care work at home.&#xD;
We must not let the legacy of the pandemic be one of rolling back the clock on women’s participation in the workforce, nor one of backtracking on the social and political gains women and allies have fought so hard to secure.&#xD;
The Government will create an Action Plan for Women in the Economy to help more women get back into the workforce and to ensure a feminist, intersectional response to this pandemic and recovery. This Plan will be guided by a task force of experts whose diverse voices will power a whole of government approach.&#xD;
It has been nearly 50 years since the Royal Commission on the Status of Women outlined the necessity of child care services for women’s social and economic equality. We have long understood that Canada cannot succeed if half of the population is held back. Canadians need more accessible, affordable, inclusive, and high quality childcare.&#xD;
Recognizing the urgency of this challenge, the Government will make a significant, long-term, sustained investment to create a Canada-wide early learning and childcare system.&#xD;
The Government will build on previous investments, learn from the model that already exists in Quebec, and work with all provinces and territories to ensure that high-quality care is accessible to all.&#xD;
There is broad consensus from all parts of society, including business and labour leaders, that the time is now.&#xD;
The Government also remains committed to subsidizing before- and after-school program costs. With the way that this pandemic has affected parents and families, flexible care options for primary school children are more important than ever.&#xD;
The Government will also accelerate the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, which has already helped women across Canada grow their businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUPPORTING BUSINESSES&#xD;
As the Government invests in people, it will continue to support job-creating businesses.&#xD;
Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities and the backbone of the economy. The Government introduced a range of supports for Canadian businesses, from help with payroll through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to assistance with expenses through interest-free loans.&#xD;
COVID-19 has caused businesses across the country, both large and small, to rethink their approaches. Entrepreneurs and owners are looking at more digital options, more creative solutions, and more climate-friendly investments.&#xD;
The Government will help businesses adapt for the future and thrive.&#xD;
This fall, in addition to extending the wage subsidy, the Government will take further steps to bridge vulnerable businesses to the other side of the pandemic by:&#xD;
• Expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account to help businesseswith fixed costs;&#xD;
• Improving the Business Credit Availability Program;&#xD;
• And introducing further support for industries that have been the hardest hit, including travel and tourism, hospitality, and cultural industries like the performing arts.&#xD;
&#xD;
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY&#xD;
This COVID-19 emergency has had huge costs. But Canada would have had a deeper recession and a bigger long-term deficit if the Government had done less.&#xD;
With interest rates so low, central banks can only do so much to help. There is a global consensus that governments must do more. Government can do so while also locking in the low cost of borrowing for decades to come. This Government will preserve Canada’s fiscal advantage and continue to be guided by values of sustainability and prudence.&#xD;
There are two distinct needs. The first is to help Canadians in the short term, to do whatever it takes, using whatever fiscal firepower is needed to support people and businesses during the pandemic. The best way to keep the economy strong is to keep Canadians healthy.&#xD;
The second need is to build back better, with a sustainable approach for future generations. As the Government builds a plan for stimulus and recovery, this must be done responsibly.&#xD;
In the longer term, the Government will focus on targeted investments to strengthen the middle class, build resiliency, and generate growth. The Government will also identify additional ways to tax extreme wealth inequality, including by concluding work to limit the stock option deduction for wealthy individuals at large, established corporations, and addressing corporate tax avoidance by digital giants.&#xD;
Web giants are taking Canadians’ money while imposing their own priorities. Things must change, and will change. The Government will act to ensure their revenue is shared more fairly with our creators and media, and will also require them to contribute to the creation, production, and distribution of our stories, on screen, in lyrics, in music, and in writing.&#xD;
This fall, the Government will release an update to Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. This will outline the Government’s economic and fiscal position, provide fiscal projections, and set out new measures to implement this Throne Speech.&#xD;
This update will make clear that the strength of the middle class, and the wellbeing of all Canadians, remain Canada’s key measures of success.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building Back Better: A Resilience Agenda For the Middle Class" id="id-61d26642269c44b08317f30b8de7fb6a">
      <documentation>As we fight for every Canadian and defend everyone’s ability to succeed, we also need to focus on the future, and on building back better. This forms the third foundation of the Government’s approach.&#xD;
Around the world, advanced economies are realizing that things should not go back to business as usual. COVID-19 has exposed the vulnerabilities in our societies.&#xD;
The Government will create a resiliency agenda for the middle class and people working hard to join it.&#xD;
This will include addressing the gaps in our social systems, investing in health care, and creating jobs. It will also include fighting climate change, and maintaining a commitment to fiscal sustainability and economic growth as the foundation of a strong and vibrant society.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESSING GAPS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS&#xD;
Central to this is recognizing that one of the greatest tragedies of this pandemic is the lives lost in long-term care homes. Elders deserve to be safe, respected, and live in dignity.&#xD;
Although long-term care falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, the federal government will take any action it can to support seniors while working alongside the provinces and territories.&#xD;
The Government will work with Parliament on Criminal Code amendments to explicitly penalize those who neglect seniors under their care, putting them in danger.&#xD;
The Government will also:&#xD;
• Work with the provinces and territories to set new, national standards for long-term care so that seniors get the best support possible;&#xD;
• And take additional action to help people stay in their homes longer.&#xD;
The Government remains committed to increasing Old Age Security once a senior turns 75, and boosting the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit.&#xD;
The Government will look at further targeted measures for personal support workers, who do an essential service helping the most vulnerable in our communities. Canada must better value their work and their contributions to our society.&#xD;
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Canadians with disabilities, and highlighted long-standing challenges. The Government will bring forward a Disability Inclusion Plan, which will have:&#xD;
• A new Canadian Disability Benefit modelled after the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors;&#xD;
• A robust employment strategy for Canadians with disabilities;&#xD;
• And a better process to determine eligibility for Government disability programs and benefits.&#xD;
Over the last six months, it has become clearer than ever why Canadians need a resilient health care system.&#xD;
The Government will ensure that everyone – including in rural and remote areas – has access to a family doctor or primary care team. COVID-19 has also shown that our system needs to be more flexible and able to reach people at home. The Government will continue to expand capacity to deliver virtual health care.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to address the opioid epidemic tearing through communities, which is an ongoing and worsening public health crisis. Additionally, the Government will further increase access to mental health resources. All Canadians should have the care they need, when they need it. We will all be stronger for it.&#xD;
The same goes for access to the medicine that keeps people healthy. Many Canadians who had drug plans through work lost this coverage when they were laid off because of the pandemic. So this is exactly the right moment to ramp up efforts to address that.&#xD;
The Government remains committed to a national, universal pharmacare program and will accelerate steps to achieve this system including:&#xD;
• Through a rare-disease strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs;&#xD;
• Establishing a national formulary to keep drug prices low; &#xD;
• And working with provinces and territories willing to move forward without delay.&#xD;
In addition to good health infrastructure, Canadians also need strong, safe communities to call home.&#xD;
The Government has banned assault-style firearms. The Government will also continue implementing firearms policy commitments, including:&#xD;
• Giving municipalities the ability to further restrict or ban handguns;&#xD;
• And strengthening measures to control the flow of illegal guns into Canada.&#xD;
Women’s safety must be the foundation on which all progress is built. The Government will accelerate investments in shelters and transition housing, and continue to advance with a National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence.&#xD;
To keep building strong communities, over the next two years the Government will also invest in all types of infrastructure, including public transit, energy efficient retrofits, clean energy, rural broadband, and affordable housing, particularly for Indigenous Peoples and northern communities.&#xD;
In the last six months, many more people have worked from home, done classes from the kitchen table, shopped online, and accessed government services remotely. So it has become more important than ever that all Canadians have access to the internet.&#xD;
The Government will accelerate the connectivity timelines and ambitions of the Universal Broadband Fund to ensure that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed internet.&#xD;
And to further link our communities together, the Government will work with partners to support regional routes for airlines. It is essential that Canadians have access to reliable and affordable regional air services. This is an issue of equity, of jobs, and of economic development. The Government will work to support this.&#xD;
Strong communities are places where everyone has a safe, affordable home. No one should be without a place to stay during a pandemic, or for that matter, a Canadian winter.&#xD;
This week, the Government invested more than $1 billion for people experiencing homelessness, including for this fall.&#xD;
In 2017, the Government announced that it would reduce chronic homelessness by 50 percent. The Government has already helped more than a million people get a safe and affordable place to call home. Given the progress that has been made, and our commitment to do more, the Government is now focused on entirely eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will also make substantial investments in housing for Canadians.&#xD;
The Government will add to the historic National Housing Strategy announced in 2017 by increasing investments to rapid housing in the short term, and partnering with not-for-profits and co-ops in the mid- to long-term. For the middle class, the Government will also move forward with enhancements to the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, including in Canada’s largest cities, so families can afford to buy their first home.&#xD;
Housing is something everyone deserves, and it’s also a key driver of the economy. Construction projects create jobs, and having a home is critical so people can contribute to their communities.&#xD;
Just like everyone deserves a home, everyone deserves to be able to put nutritious food on the table.&#xD;
The pandemic has made that harder for Canadians. The Government will continue to work with partners – including directly with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation partners – to address food insecurity in Canada. The Government will also strengthen local food supply chains here in Canada.&#xD;
The Canadian and migrant workers who produce, harvest, and process our food – from people picking fruit to packing seafood – have done an outstanding job getting good food on people’s plates. They deserve the Government’s full support and protection.&#xD;
The Government will also ensure that those in Canada’s supply managed sectors receive full and fair compensation for recent trade agreements. Farmers keep our families fed, and we will continue to help them succeed and grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
A STRONGER WORKFORCE&#xD;
This pandemic has revealed gaps in health, housing, and food supply. And it has also laid bare inequalities Canadians face in the workforce.&#xD;
We have an opportunity to not just support Canadians, but grow their potential. Working with the provinces and territories, the Government will make the largest investment in Canadian history in training for workers. This will include by:&#xD;
• Supporting Canadians as they build new skills in growing sectors;&#xD;
• Helping workers receive education and accreditation;&#xD;
• And strengthening workers’ futures, by connecting them to employers and good jobs, in order to grow and strengthen the middle class.&#xD;
From researchers developing vaccines, to entrepreneurs building online stores, this pandemic has reminded us of the power of the knowledge economy, and how vital it is for our future.&#xD;
Canadians are leading, and they should have government services that keep up.&#xD;
The Government will make generational investments in updating outdated IT systems to modernize the way that Government serves Canadians, from the elderly to the young, from people looking for work to those living with a disability.&#xD;
The Government will also work to introduce free, automatic tax filing for simple returns to ensure citizens receive the benefits they need.&#xD;
Government must remain agile, and ready for what lies ahead.&#xD;
&#xD;
TAKING ACTION ON EXTREME RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE&#xD;
Climate action will be a cornerstone of our plan to support and create a millionjobs across the country.&#xD;
This is where the world is going. Global consumers and investors are demanding and rewarding climate action.&#xD;
Canadians have the determination and ingenuity to rise to this challenge and global market opportunity.&#xD;
We can create good jobs today and a globally competitive economy not just next year, but in 2030, 2040, and beyond.&#xD;
Canadians also know climate change threatens our health, way of life, and planet. They want climate action now, and that is what the Government will continue to deliver.&#xD;
The Government will immediately bring forward a plan to exceed Canada’s 2030 climate goal. The Government will also legislate Canada’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.&#xD;
As part of its plan, the Government will:&#xD;
• Create thousands of jobs retrofitting homes and buildings, cutting energy costs for Canadian families and businesses;&#xD;
• Invest in reducing the impact of climate-related disasters, like floods and wildfires, to make communities safer and more resilient;&#xD;
• Help deliver more transit and active transit options;&#xD;
• And make zero-emissions vehicles more affordable while investing in more charging stations across the country.&#xD;
A good example of adapting to a carbon-neutral future is building zero-emissions vehicles and batteries. Canada has the resources – from nickel to copper – needed for these clean technologies. This – combined with Canadian expertise – is Canada’s competitive edge.&#xD;
The Government will launch a new fund to attract investments in making zero-emissions products and cut the corporate tax rate in half for these companies to create jobs and make Canada a world leader in clean technology. The Government will ensure Canada is the most competitive jurisdiction in the world for clean technology companies.&#xD;
Additionally, the Government will:&#xD;
• Transform how we power our economy and communities by moving forward with the Clean Power Fund, including with projects like the Atlantic Loop that will connect surplus clean power to regions transitioning away from coal;&#xD;
• And support investments in renewable energy and next-generation clean energy and technology solutions.&#xD;
Canada cannot reach net zero without the know-how of the energy sector, and the innovative ideas of all Canadians, including people in places like British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador.&#xD;
The Government will:&#xD;
• Support manufacturing, natural resource, and energy sectors as they work to transform to meet a net zero future, creating good-paying and long-lasting jobs;&#xD;
• And recognize farmers, foresters, and ranchers as key partners in the fight against climate change, supporting their efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience.&#xD;
The Government will continue its policy of putting a price on pollution, while putting that money back in the pockets of Canadians. It cannot be free to pollute.&#xD;
This pandemic has reminded Canadians of the importance of nature. The Government will work with municipalities as part of a new commitment to expand urban parks, so that everyone has access to green space. This will be done while protecting a quarter of Canada’s land and a quarter of Canada’s oceans in five years, and using nature-based solutions to fight climate change, including by planting two billion trees.&#xD;
The Government will ban harmful single-use plastics next year and ensure more plastic is recycled. And the Government will also modernize Canada’s Environmental Protection Act.&#xD;
When the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration was closed by a previous government, Canada lost an important tool to manage its waters. The Government will create a new Canada Water Agency to keep our water safe, clean, and well-managed. The Government will also identify opportunities to build more resilient water and irrigation infrastructure.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will look at continuing to grow Canada’s ocean economy to create opportunities for fishers and coastal communities, while advancing reconciliation and conservation objectives. Investing in the Blue Economy will help Canada prosper.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="The Canada We're Fighting For" id="id-0d51f13226ae4fb595ba0b6ff3c1b65c">
      <documentation>This is a fight for Canadians today and Canada tomorrow. So we must never forget the values that make us who we are. The fourth and final foundation of the Government’s approach is defending Canadian values and ensuring they are lived experiences for everyone.&#xD;
Canada is a place where we take care of each other. This has helped Canada weather the pandemic better than many other countries.&#xD;
Canada must continue to stand up for the values that define this country, whether that’s welcoming newcomers, celebrating with pride the contributions of LGBTQ2 communities, or embracing two official languages. There is work still to be done, including on the road of reconciliation, and in addressing systemic racism.&#xD;
&#xD;
RECONCILIATION&#xD;
Throughout the pandemic, the Government has made it a priority to support Indigenous communities, which has helped contain the spread of COVID-19 and kept people safe. That is something the Government will continue to do.&#xD;
The Government will walk the shared path of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and remain focused on implementing the commitments made in 2019.&#xD;
However, the pandemic has shown that we need to keep moving forward even faster on a number of fronts including by:&#xD;
• Expediting work to co-develop distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation, and a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy;&#xD;
• Accelerating work on the National Action Plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls’ Calls for Justice, as well as implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action;&#xD;
• And continuing to close the infrastructure gap in Indigenous communities, working on a distinctions-basis with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation to accelerate the government’s 10-year commitment.&#xD;
The Government will also:&#xD;
• Make additional resiliency investments to meet the clean drinking water commitment in First Nations communities;&#xD;
• And support additional capacity-building for First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation.&#xD;
The Government will move forward to introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples before the end of this year.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM&#xD;
For too many Canadians, systemic racism is a lived reality. We know that racism did not take a pause during the pandemic. On the contrary, COVID-19 has hit racialized Canadians especially hard.&#xD;
Many people – especially Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians – have raised their voices and stood up to demand change.&#xD;
They are telling us we must do more. The Government agrees.&#xD;
The Government pledged to address systemic racism, and committed to do so in a way informed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and Indigenous Peoples.&#xD;
The Government has invested in economic empowerment through the Black Entrepreneurship Program, while working to close the gaps in services for Indigenous communities. Important steps were taken with the release of Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy for 2019-2022, the creation of an anti-racism secretariat, and the appointment of the first-ever Minister focused specifically on diversity and inclusion. This is all good, but much more needs to be done for permanent, transformative change to take shape.&#xD;
The Government will redouble its efforts by:&#xD;
• Taking action on online hate;&#xD;
• Going further on economic empowerment for specific communities, and increasing diversity on procurement;&#xD;
• Building a whole-of-federal-government approach around better collection of disaggregated data;&#xD;
• Implementing an action plan to increase representation in hiring and appointments, and leadership development within the Public Service;&#xD;
• And taking new steps to support the artistic and economic contributions of Black Canadian culture and heritage.&#xD;
Progress must also be made throughout the policing and justice systems. All Canadians must have the confidence that the justice system is there to protect them, not to harm them. Black Canadians and Indigenous Peoples are&#xD;
overrepresented in the criminal justice system. That has to change.&#xD;
The Government will take steps to ensure that the strong hand of criminal justice is used where it is needed to keep people safe, but not where it would be discriminatory or counterproductive.&#xD;
The Government will:&#xD;
• Introduce legislation and make investments that take action to address the systemic inequities in all phases of the criminal justice system, from diversion to sentencing, from rehabilitation to records;&#xD;
• Move forward on enhanced civilian oversight of our law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP;&#xD;
• Modernize training for police and law enforcement, including addressing standards around the use of force;&#xD;
• Move forward on RCMP reforms, with a shift toward community-led policing;&#xD;
• And accelerate work to co-develop a legislative framework for First Nations policing as an essential service.&#xD;
&#xD;
PROTECTING TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES&#xD;
Our two official languages are woven into the fabric of our country.&#xD;
The defence of the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, and the defence of the rights of the Anglophone minority within Quebec, is a priority for the Government.&#xD;
The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique. There are almost 8 million Francophones in Canada within a region of over 360 million inhabitants who are almost exclusively Anglophone. The Government therefore has the responsibility to protect and promote French not only outside of Quebec, but also within Quebec.&#xD;
In this vein, 51 years after the passage of the Official Languages Act, the Government is committed to strengthening this legislation among other things, taking into consideration the unique reality of French.&#xD;
&#xD;
A WELCOMING CANADA&#xD;
Immigration remains a driver of Canada’s economic growth.&#xD;
With other countries rejecting global talent that could help their economy, Canada has an opportunity as we recover to become the world’s top destination for talent, capital, and jobs. When people choose Canada, help build Canada, and make sacrifices in support of Canada, we should make it easier for them to formally become Canadian.&#xD;
Earlier this year, the Government announced measures to grant permanent residency to people who, although not Canadian citizens, had cared for the most vulnerable in long-term care homes and other medical facilities.&#xD;
The Government will continue to bring in newcomers and support family reunification. We know that there is an economic and human advantage to having families together.&#xD;
As part of both the short-term economic recovery and a long-term plan for growth, the Government will leverage the advantage we have on immigration to keep Canada competitive on the world stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
CANADA IN THE WORLD&#xD;
We must take action on all of these priorities at home. But we must also address the world in which we live. COVID-19 has accelerated the existing trends toward a more fragmented global order. It remains in Canada’s interest to create and maintain bilateral and multilateral relationships to advance peace and economic prosperity.&#xD;
The Government will invest more in international development while supporting developing countries on their economic recoveries and resilience. Canada will also support work to ensure that people around the world have access to a vaccine. We cannot eliminate this pandemic in Canada unless we end it everywhere.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to stand up for human rights and the rule of law. It is unacceptable that any citizen be arbitrarily detained. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor must be brought home. This is something for which all Canadians stand united.&#xD;
The Government will continue to fight for free trade, including by leading the Ottawa Group to reform the World Trade Organization.&#xD;
Our likeminded allies and partners are investing to make sure their societies emerge stronger. This Government’s plan does that as well.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Protecting Canadians From COVID-19" id="id-668c5b74667c49498860bbecbc9e613b">
      <documentation>The first foundation of the Government’s approach is protecting Canadians from COVID-19.&#xD;
This is priority number one.&#xD;
It is the job of the federal government to look out for all Canadians and especially our most vulnerable. We need to work together. Beating this virus is a Team Canada effort.&#xD;
Over the last six months, Canadians have stood united and strong. Their actions embody what has always been the purpose of the federal government: bringing Canadians together to achieve common goals.&#xD;
Personal protective equipment has been shipped across the country. Members of the Canadian Forces were there in long-term care homes. Close to 9 million Canadians were helped with the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and over 3.5 million jobs were supported by the wage subsidy.&#xD;
The Government will continue to have people’s backs just like Canadians have each other’s backs.&#xD;
Through the first wave, contact tracing and testing ramped up across the country. The surge this fall further reinforces what we already know – that we must do even more.&#xD;
The federal government will be there to help the provinces increase their testing capacity. Canadians should not be waiting in line for hours to get a test.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government is pursuing every technology and every option for faster tests for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. As soon as tests are approved for safe use in Canada, the Government will do everything it can to see them deployed. The Government will also create a federal Testing Assistance Response Team to quickly meet surge testing needs, including in remote and isolated communities.&#xD;
Local public health authorities are the backbone of our nation’s efforts to stop outbreaks before they start. As members of the communities they protect, they know the devastating economic impact a lockdown order can have.&#xD;
To prevent small clusters from becoming major outbreaks, communities may need to enact short-term closure orders. To make that decision easier for the public health authorities, and to help ease the impact that science- and evidence-based decisions can have on local businesses in the short term, the Government will work to target additional financial support directly to businesses which have to temporarily shut down as a result of a local public health decision.&#xD;
This will ensure that decisions are made with the health of Canadians as the first priority.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to work on what communities need more broadly.&#xD;
The Government has already invested over $19 billion for a Safe Restart Agreement with provinces and territories, to support everything from the capacity of health care systems to securing PPE.&#xD;
To address the challenges faced by provinces and territories as they reopen classrooms, the federal government invested $2 billion in the Safe Return to Class Fund, along with new funding for First Nations communities. This is money to keep kids – and staff – safe in the classroom, whether that’s by helping schools buy cleaning supplies or upgrade ventilation.&#xD;
These commitments build on federal investments to support people who are most at risk and those who care for them, including with the federal wage top-up for personal support workers. People on the frontlines who have been looking after seniors do vital work and the Government will continue to have their backs.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will continue to support Canadians as they take action to keep each other safe.&#xD;
Already, people are doing their part by wearing masks. That’s important, and we can build on that commitment. Working with private sector partners, the federal government created the COVID Alert app. Canadians living in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan now have an extra tool to keep themselves and others safe. The Government hopes all the others will sign on so that people in all parts of the country can both do their part and be better protected.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to work on getting Canadians the PPE they need.&#xD;
This spring, the Government issued a call, and thousands of Canadian businesses and manufacturers responded. From shop floors to companies big and small, Canada’s dynamic businesses met the challenge as their workers stepped up. &#xD;
And in less than six months, Canadians are now manufacturing almost all types of PPE. The Government will continue building that domestic capacity, while securing supply chains to keep Canadians safe and create jobs.&#xD;
Canadians are pulling together, whether that’s with PPE manufacturing, through the COVID Alert app, or by wearing a mask. In the same way, Canadian researchers and scientists are pitching in to the Team Canada effort with their knowledge and expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
VACCINE EFFORTS&#xD;
In the long run, the best way to end this pandemic is with a safe and effective vaccine.&#xD;
Canada’s vaccine strategy is all about ensuring that Canadians will be able to get a vaccine once it is ready.&#xD;
There are many types of potential candidates. Canada is exploring the full range of options. The Government has already secured access to vaccine candidates and therapeutics, while investing in manufacturing here at home. And to get the vaccines out to Canadians once they’re ready, the Government has made further investments in our capacity for vaccine distribution.&#xD;
From the Vaccine Task Force that provides the best advice on vaccine purchasing and roll-out, to the Immunity Task Force looking at how COVID-19 is affecting vulnerable populations, Canada’s top scientific minds are guiding the Government every step of the way.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Helping Canadians Through The Pandemic" id="id-20bedbf4718a4e558ae37acdaa3b17f0">
      <documentation>The medical and scientific fight against this virus is crucial. And so are the livelihoods of every single Canadian, worker, and family.&#xD;
So the second foundation of the Government’s approach is supporting Canadians through this crisis.&#xD;
The economic impact of COVID-19 on Canadians has already been worse than the 2008 financial crisis. These consequences will not be short-lived.&#xD;
This is not the time for austerity. Canada entered this crisis in the best fiscal position of its peers. And the Government is using that fiscal firepower, on things like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, so that Canadians, businesses, and our entire economy have the support needed to weather the storm.&#xD;
Canadians should not have to choose between health and their job, just like Canadians should not have to take on debt that their government can better shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
CREATING JOBS&#xD;
People losing their jobs is perhaps the clearest consequence of the global economic shock that Canadians – like those in other countries – have faced.&#xD;
The CERB helped people stay healthy at home while being able to keep food on the table.&#xD;
The CEWS helped people keep their jobs, or be rehired if they had been laid off.&#xD;
But there is still more to be done.&#xD;
Unemployment is in the double digits, and underemployment is high.&#xD;
Women, racialized Canadians, and young people have borne the brunt of job losses.&#xD;
Canadians need good jobs they can rely on.&#xD;
To help make that happen, the Government will launch a campaign to create over one million jobs, restoring employment to previous levels. This will be done by using a range of tools, including direct investments in the social sector and infrastructure, immediate training to quickly skill up workers, and incentives for employers to hire and retain workers.&#xD;
One way the Government will create these jobs is by extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy right through to next summer. The Government will work with businesses and labour to ensure the program meets the needs of the health and economic situation as it evolves.&#xD;
Another example of how the Government will create jobs is by significantly scaling up the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, to provide more paid work experiences next year for young Canadians.&#xD;
Now, more than ever, Canadians must work together – including by eliminating remaining barriers between provinces to full, free internal trade – to get the economy back up and running and Canadians back to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUPPORTING WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES&#xD;
With the job losses that Canadians have faced, it became clear early on that many people would need help until they could find work once again. But existing income support systems were not designed to handle this unprecedented situation. That’s why the Government moved quickly to create the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as a temporary program to help millions of Canadians get through a very difficult time.&#xD;
With the economic restart now well underway, CERB recipients should instead be supported by the Employment Insurance system. For people who would not traditionally qualify for EI, the Government will create the transitional Canada Recovery Benefit.&#xD;
Over the coming months, the EI system will become the sole delivery mechanism for employment benefits, including for Canadians who did not qualify for EI before the pandemic. This pandemic has shown that Canada needs an EI system for the 21st century, including for the self-employed and those in the gig economy. &#xD;
&#xD;
WOMEN IN THE ECONOMY&#xD;
Women – and in particular low-income women – have been hit hardest by COVID-19. This crisis has been described as a She-cession.&#xD;
Many women have bravely served on the frontlines of this crisis, in our communities or by shouldering the burden of unpaid care work at home.&#xD;
We must not let the legacy of the pandemic be one of rolling back the clock on women’s participation in the workforce, nor one of backtracking on the social and political gains women and allies have fought so hard to secure.&#xD;
The Government will create an Action Plan for Women in the Economy to help more women get back into the workforce and to ensure a feminist, intersectional response to this pandemic and recovery. This Plan will be guided by a task force of experts whose diverse voices will power a whole of government approach.&#xD;
It has been nearly 50 years since the Royal Commission on the Status of Women outlined the necessity of child care services for women’s social and economic equality. We have long understood that Canada cannot succeed if half of the population is held back. Canadians need more accessible, affordable, inclusive, and high quality childcare.&#xD;
Recognizing the urgency of this challenge, the Government will make a significant, long-term, sustained investment to create a Canada-wide early learning and childcare system.&#xD;
The Government will build on previous investments, learn from the model that already exists in Quebec, and work with all provinces and territories to ensure that high-quality care is accessible to all.&#xD;
There is broad consensus from all parts of society, including business and labour leaders, that the time is now.&#xD;
The Government also remains committed to subsidizing before- and after-school program costs. With the way that this pandemic has affected parents and families, flexible care options for primary school children are more important than ever.&#xD;
The Government will also accelerate the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, which has already helped women across Canada grow their businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUPPORTING BUSINESSES&#xD;
As the Government invests in people, it will continue to support job-creating businesses.&#xD;
Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities and the backbone of the economy. The Government introduced a range of supports for Canadian businesses, from help with payroll through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to assistance with expenses through interest-free loans.&#xD;
COVID-19 has caused businesses across the country, both large and small, to rethink their approaches. Entrepreneurs and owners are looking at more digital options, more creative solutions, and more climate-friendly investments.&#xD;
The Government will help businesses adapt for the future and thrive.&#xD;
This fall, in addition to extending the wage subsidy, the Government will take further steps to bridge vulnerable businesses to the other side of the pandemic by:&#xD;
• Expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account to help businesseswith fixed costs;&#xD;
• Improving the Business Credit Availability Program;&#xD;
• And introducing further support for industries that have been the hardest hit, including travel and tourism, hospitality, and cultural industries like the performing arts.&#xD;
&#xD;
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY&#xD;
This COVID-19 emergency has had huge costs. But Canada would have had a deeper recession and a bigger long-term deficit if the Government had done less.&#xD;
With interest rates so low, central banks can only do so much to help. There is a global consensus that governments must do more. Government can do so while also locking in the low cost of borrowing for decades to come. This Government will preserve Canada’s fiscal advantage and continue to be guided by values of sustainability and prudence.&#xD;
There are two distinct needs. The first is to help Canadians in the short term, to do whatever it takes, using whatever fiscal firepower is needed to support people and businesses during the pandemic. The best way to keep the economy strong is to keep Canadians healthy.&#xD;
The second need is to build back better, with a sustainable approach for future generations. As the Government builds a plan for stimulus and recovery, this must be done responsibly.&#xD;
In the longer term, the Government will focus on targeted investments to strengthen the middle class, build resiliency, and generate growth. The Government will also identify additional ways to tax extreme wealth inequality, including by concluding work to limit the stock option deduction for wealthy individuals at large, established corporations, and addressing corporate tax avoidance by digital giants.&#xD;
Web giants are taking Canadians’ money while imposing their own priorities. Things must change, and will change. The Government will act to ensure their revenue is shared more fairly with our creators and media, and will also require them to contribute to the creation, production, and distribution of our stories, on screen, in lyrics, in music, and in writing.&#xD;
This fall, the Government will release an update to Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. This will outline the Government’s economic and fiscal position, provide fiscal projections, and set out new measures to implement this Throne Speech.&#xD;
This update will make clear that the strength of the middle class, and the wellbeing of all Canadians, remain Canada’s key measures of success.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building Back Better: A Resilience Agenda For the Middle Class" id="id-da6ef6e8eacd4d4195e34e9cd75354d5">
      <documentation>As we fight for every Canadian and defend everyone’s ability to succeed, we also need to focus on the future, and on building back better. This forms the third foundation of the Government’s approach.&#xD;
Around the world, advanced economies are realizing that things should not go back to business as usual. COVID-19 has exposed the vulnerabilities in our societies.&#xD;
The Government will create a resiliency agenda for the middle class and people working hard to join it.&#xD;
This will include addressing the gaps in our social systems, investing in health care, and creating jobs. It will also include fighting climate change, and maintaining a commitment to fiscal sustainability and economic growth as the foundation of a strong and vibrant society.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESSING GAPS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS&#xD;
Central to this is recognizing that one of the greatest tragedies of this pandemic is the lives lost in long-term care homes. Elders deserve to be safe, respected, and live in dignity.&#xD;
Although long-term care falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, the federal government will take any action it can to support seniors while working alongside the provinces and territories.&#xD;
The Government will work with Parliament on Criminal Code amendments to explicitly penalize those who neglect seniors under their care, putting them in danger.&#xD;
The Government will also:&#xD;
• Work with the provinces and territories to set new, national standards for long-term care so that seniors get the best support possible;&#xD;
• And take additional action to help people stay in their homes longer.&#xD;
The Government remains committed to increasing Old Age Security once a senior turns 75, and boosting the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit.&#xD;
The Government will look at further targeted measures for personal support workers, who do an essential service helping the most vulnerable in our communities. Canada must better value their work and their contributions to our society.&#xD;
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Canadians with disabilities, and highlighted long-standing challenges. The Government will bring forward a Disability Inclusion Plan, which will have:&#xD;
• A new Canadian Disability Benefit modelled after the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors;&#xD;
• A robust employment strategy for Canadians with disabilities;&#xD;
• And a better process to determine eligibility for Government disability programs and benefits.&#xD;
Over the last six months, it has become clearer than ever why Canadians need a resilient health care system.&#xD;
The Government will ensure that everyone – including in rural and remote areas – has access to a family doctor or primary care team. COVID-19 has also shown that our system needs to be more flexible and able to reach people at home. The Government will continue to expand capacity to deliver virtual health care.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to address the opioid epidemic tearing through communities, which is an ongoing and worsening public health crisis. Additionally, the Government will further increase access to mental health resources. All Canadians should have the care they need, when they need it. We will all be stronger for it.&#xD;
The same goes for access to the medicine that keeps people healthy. Many Canadians who had drug plans through work lost this coverage when they were laid off because of the pandemic. So this is exactly the right moment to ramp up efforts to address that.&#xD;
The Government remains committed to a national, universal pharmacare program and will accelerate steps to achieve this system including:&#xD;
• Through a rare-disease strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs;&#xD;
• Establishing a national formulary to keep drug prices low; &#xD;
• And working with provinces and territories willing to move forward without delay.&#xD;
In addition to good health infrastructure, Canadians also need strong, safe communities to call home.&#xD;
The Government has banned assault-style firearms. The Government will also continue implementing firearms policy commitments, including:&#xD;
• Giving municipalities the ability to further restrict or ban handguns;&#xD;
• And strengthening measures to control the flow of illegal guns into Canada.&#xD;
Women’s safety must be the foundation on which all progress is built. The Government will accelerate investments in shelters and transition housing, and continue to advance with a National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence.&#xD;
To keep building strong communities, over the next two years the Government will also invest in all types of infrastructure, including public transit, energy efficient retrofits, clean energy, rural broadband, and affordable housing, particularly for Indigenous Peoples and northern communities.&#xD;
In the last six months, many more people have worked from home, done classes from the kitchen table, shopped online, and accessed government services remotely. So it has become more important than ever that all Canadians have access to the internet.&#xD;
The Government will accelerate the connectivity timelines and ambitions of the Universal Broadband Fund to ensure that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed internet.&#xD;
And to further link our communities together, the Government will work with partners to support regional routes for airlines. It is essential that Canadians have access to reliable and affordable regional air services. This is an issue of equity, of jobs, and of economic development. The Government will work to support this.&#xD;
Strong communities are places where everyone has a safe, affordable home. No one should be without a place to stay during a pandemic, or for that matter, a Canadian winter.&#xD;
This week, the Government invested more than $1 billion for people experiencing homelessness, including for this fall.&#xD;
In 2017, the Government announced that it would reduce chronic homelessness by 50 percent. The Government has already helped more than a million people get a safe and affordable place to call home. Given the progress that has been made, and our commitment to do more, the Government is now focused on entirely eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will also make substantial investments in housing for Canadians.&#xD;
The Government will add to the historic National Housing Strategy announced in 2017 by increasing investments to rapid housing in the short term, and partnering with not-for-profits and co-ops in the mid- to long-term. For the middle class, the Government will also move forward with enhancements to the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, including in Canada’s largest cities, so families can afford to buy their first home.&#xD;
Housing is something everyone deserves, and it’s also a key driver of the economy. Construction projects create jobs, and having a home is critical so people can contribute to their communities.&#xD;
Just like everyone deserves a home, everyone deserves to be able to put nutritious food on the table.&#xD;
The pandemic has made that harder for Canadians. The Government will continue to work with partners – including directly with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation partners – to address food insecurity in Canada. The Government will also strengthen local food supply chains here in Canada.&#xD;
The Canadian and migrant workers who produce, harvest, and process our food – from people picking fruit to packing seafood – have done an outstanding job getting good food on people’s plates. They deserve the Government’s full support and protection.&#xD;
The Government will also ensure that those in Canada’s supply managed sectors receive full and fair compensation for recent trade agreements. Farmers keep our families fed, and we will continue to help them succeed and grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
A STRONGER WORKFORCE&#xD;
This pandemic has revealed gaps in health, housing, and food supply. And it has also laid bare inequalities Canadians face in the workforce.&#xD;
We have an opportunity to not just support Canadians, but grow their potential. Working with the provinces and territories, the Government will make the largest investment in Canadian history in training for workers. This will include by:&#xD;
• Supporting Canadians as they build new skills in growing sectors;&#xD;
• Helping workers receive education and accreditation;&#xD;
• And strengthening workers’ futures, by connecting them to employers and good jobs, in order to grow and strengthen the middle class.&#xD;
From researchers developing vaccines, to entrepreneurs building online stores, this pandemic has reminded us of the power of the knowledge economy, and how vital it is for our future.&#xD;
Canadians are leading, and they should have government services that keep up.&#xD;
The Government will make generational investments in updating outdated IT systems to modernize the way that Government serves Canadians, from the elderly to the young, from people looking for work to those living with a disability.&#xD;
The Government will also work to introduce free, automatic tax filing for simple returns to ensure citizens receive the benefits they need.&#xD;
Government must remain agile, and ready for what lies ahead.&#xD;
&#xD;
TAKING ACTION ON EXTREME RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE&#xD;
Climate action will be a cornerstone of our plan to support and create a millionjobs across the country.&#xD;
This is where the world is going. Global consumers and investors are demanding and rewarding climate action.&#xD;
Canadians have the determination and ingenuity to rise to this challenge and global market opportunity.&#xD;
We can create good jobs today and a globally competitive economy not just next year, but in 2030, 2040, and beyond.&#xD;
Canadians also know climate change threatens our health, way of life, and planet. They want climate action now, and that is what the Government will continue to deliver.&#xD;
The Government will immediately bring forward a plan to exceed Canada’s 2030 climate goal. The Government will also legislate Canada’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.&#xD;
As part of its plan, the Government will:&#xD;
• Create thousands of jobs retrofitting homes and buildings, cutting energy costs for Canadian families and businesses;&#xD;
• Invest in reducing the impact of climate-related disasters, like floods and wildfires, to make communities safer and more resilient;&#xD;
• Help deliver more transit and active transit options;&#xD;
• And make zero-emissions vehicles more affordable while investing in more charging stations across the country.&#xD;
A good example of adapting to a carbon-neutral future is building zero-emissions vehicles and batteries. Canada has the resources – from nickel to copper – needed for these clean technologies. This – combined with Canadian expertise – is Canada’s competitive edge.&#xD;
The Government will launch a new fund to attract investments in making zero-emissions products and cut the corporate tax rate in half for these companies to create jobs and make Canada a world leader in clean technology. The Government will ensure Canada is the most competitive jurisdiction in the world for clean technology companies.&#xD;
Additionally, the Government will:&#xD;
• Transform how we power our economy and communities by moving forward with the Clean Power Fund, including with projects like the Atlantic Loop that will connect surplus clean power to regions transitioning away from coal;&#xD;
• And support investments in renewable energy and next-generation clean energy and technology solutions.&#xD;
Canada cannot reach net zero without the know-how of the energy sector, and the innovative ideas of all Canadians, including people in places like British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador.&#xD;
The Government will:&#xD;
• Support manufacturing, natural resource, and energy sectors as they work to transform to meet a net zero future, creating good-paying and long-lasting jobs;&#xD;
• And recognize farmers, foresters, and ranchers as key partners in the fight against climate change, supporting their efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience.&#xD;
The Government will continue its policy of putting a price on pollution, while putting that money back in the pockets of Canadians. It cannot be free to pollute.&#xD;
This pandemic has reminded Canadians of the importance of nature. The Government will work with municipalities as part of a new commitment to expand urban parks, so that everyone has access to green space. This will be done while protecting a quarter of Canada’s land and a quarter of Canada’s oceans in five years, and using nature-based solutions to fight climate change, including by planting two billion trees.&#xD;
The Government will ban harmful single-use plastics next year and ensure more plastic is recycled. And the Government will also modernize Canada’s Environmental Protection Act.&#xD;
When the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration was closed by a previous government, Canada lost an important tool to manage its waters. The Government will create a new Canada Water Agency to keep our water safe, clean, and well-managed. The Government will also identify opportunities to build more resilient water and irrigation infrastructure.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will look at continuing to grow Canada’s ocean economy to create opportunities for fishers and coastal communities, while advancing reconciliation and conservation objectives. Investing in the Blue Economy will help Canada prosper.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="The Canada We're Fighting For" id="id-dde453a689b045f6a5771ae82fc9cb36">
      <documentation>This is a fight for Canadians today and Canada tomorrow. So we must never forget the values that make us who we are. The fourth and final foundation of the Government’s approach is defending Canadian values and ensuring they are lived experiences for everyone.&#xD;
Canada is a place where we take care of each other. This has helped Canada weather the pandemic better than many other countries.&#xD;
Canada must continue to stand up for the values that define this country, whether that’s welcoming newcomers, celebrating with pride the contributions of LGBTQ2 communities, or embracing two official languages. There is work still to be done, including on the road of reconciliation, and in addressing systemic racism.&#xD;
&#xD;
RECONCILIATION&#xD;
Throughout the pandemic, the Government has made it a priority to support Indigenous communities, which has helped contain the spread of COVID-19 and kept people safe. That is something the Government will continue to do.&#xD;
The Government will walk the shared path of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and remain focused on implementing the commitments made in 2019.&#xD;
However, the pandemic has shown that we need to keep moving forward even faster on a number of fronts including by:&#xD;
• Expediting work to co-develop distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation, and a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy;&#xD;
• Accelerating work on the National Action Plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls’ Calls for Justice, as well as implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action;&#xD;
• And continuing to close the infrastructure gap in Indigenous communities, working on a distinctions-basis with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation to accelerate the government’s 10-year commitment.&#xD;
The Government will also:&#xD;
• Make additional resiliency investments to meet the clean drinking water commitment in First Nations communities;&#xD;
• And support additional capacity-building for First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation.&#xD;
The Government will move forward to introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples before the end of this year.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM&#xD;
For too many Canadians, systemic racism is a lived reality. We know that racism did not take a pause during the pandemic. On the contrary, COVID-19 has hit racialized Canadians especially hard.&#xD;
Many people – especially Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians – have raised their voices and stood up to demand change.&#xD;
They are telling us we must do more. The Government agrees.&#xD;
The Government pledged to address systemic racism, and committed to do so in a way informed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and Indigenous Peoples.&#xD;
The Government has invested in economic empowerment through the Black Entrepreneurship Program, while working to close the gaps in services for Indigenous communities. Important steps were taken with the release of Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy for 2019-2022, the creation of an anti-racism secretariat, and the appointment of the first-ever Minister focused specifically on diversity and inclusion. This is all good, but much more needs to be done for permanent, transformative change to take shape.&#xD;
The Government will redouble its efforts by:&#xD;
• Taking action on online hate;&#xD;
• Going further on economic empowerment for specific communities, and increasing diversity on procurement;&#xD;
• Building a whole-of-federal-government approach around better collection of disaggregated data;&#xD;
• Implementing an action plan to increase representation in hiring and appointments, and leadership development within the Public Service;&#xD;
• And taking new steps to support the artistic and economic contributions of Black Canadian culture and heritage.&#xD;
Progress must also be made throughout the policing and justice systems. All Canadians must have the confidence that the justice system is there to protect them, not to harm them. Black Canadians and Indigenous Peoples are&#xD;
overrepresented in the criminal justice system. That has to change.&#xD;
The Government will take steps to ensure that the strong hand of criminal justice is used where it is needed to keep people safe, but not where it would be discriminatory or counterproductive.&#xD;
The Government will:&#xD;
• Introduce legislation and make investments that take action to address the systemic inequities in all phases of the criminal justice system, from diversion to sentencing, from rehabilitation to records;&#xD;
• Move forward on enhanced civilian oversight of our law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP;&#xD;
• Modernize training for police and law enforcement, including addressing standards around the use of force;&#xD;
• Move forward on RCMP reforms, with a shift toward community-led policing;&#xD;
• And accelerate work to co-develop a legislative framework for First Nations policing as an essential service.&#xD;
&#xD;
PROTECTING TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES&#xD;
Our two official languages are woven into the fabric of our country.&#xD;
The defence of the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, and the defence of the rights of the Anglophone minority within Quebec, is a priority for the Government.&#xD;
The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique. There are almost 8 million Francophones in Canada within a region of over 360 million inhabitants who are almost exclusively Anglophone. The Government therefore has the responsibility to protect and promote French not only outside of Quebec, but also within Quebec.&#xD;
In this vein, 51 years after the passage of the Official Languages Act, the Government is committed to strengthening this legislation among other things, taking into consideration the unique reality of French.&#xD;
&#xD;
A WELCOMING CANADA&#xD;
Immigration remains a driver of Canada’s economic growth.&#xD;
With other countries rejecting global talent that could help their economy, Canada has an opportunity as we recover to become the world’s top destination for talent, capital, and jobs. When people choose Canada, help build Canada, and make sacrifices in support of Canada, we should make it easier for them to formally become Canadian.&#xD;
Earlier this year, the Government announced measures to grant permanent residency to people who, although not Canadian citizens, had cared for the most vulnerable in long-term care homes and other medical facilities.&#xD;
The Government will continue to bring in newcomers and support family reunification. We know that there is an economic and human advantage to having families together.&#xD;
As part of both the short-term economic recovery and a long-term plan for growth, the Government will leverage the advantage we have on immigration to keep Canada competitive on the world stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
CANADA IN THE WORLD&#xD;
We must take action on all of these priorities at home. But we must also address the world in which we live. COVID-19 has accelerated the existing trends toward a more fragmented global order. It remains in Canada’s interest to create and maintain bilateral and multilateral relationships to advance peace and economic prosperity.&#xD;
The Government will invest more in international development while supporting developing countries on their economic recoveries and resilience. Canada will also support work to ensure that people around the world have access to a vaccine. We cannot eliminate this pandemic in Canada unless we end it everywhere.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to stand up for human rights and the rule of law. It is unacceptable that any citizen be arbitrarily detained. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor must be brought home. This is something for which all Canadians stand united.&#xD;
The Government will continue to fight for free trade, including by leading the Ottawa Group to reform the World Trade Organization.&#xD;
Our likeminded allies and partners are investing to make sure their societies emerge stronger. This Government’s plan does that as well.</documentation>

      <documentation>Legislative guidance on the conduct of enforcement investigations by federal organizations has been  provided by the Supreme Court of Canada:&#xD;
Jarvis and Ling (2002): Supreme court rulings requiring the separation of administrative powers and criminal investigations, thus creating a segregated function to avoid Charter breaches.&#xD;
To address this guidance and other best practice recommendations, ISB sought and was awarded funding from Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) Canada to refine its enforcement investigation processes and tools.  The TBS mandate required that the processes and tools (specifically a case management system) be deployed no later than March 2022.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Requirement" name="[MICM2] Solution For Enforcement Investigations" id="id-35dd1aab694f44239609fed252e60e3b">
      <documentation>Currently, the enforcement case management function at ISB is presided over cases using Microsoft Excel and various SharePoint sites (all sites are not uniform in their design) to track and manage these cases regionally and nationally. For ISB to be effective in its obligation to conduct proper enforcement activities, a tool set more suited to the unique needs of enforcement investigations is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
The electronic solution is required to collect and track evidence, control system access, and protect data together with providing support for multi-jurisdictional collaboration while operating within the given legal and Charter constraints. &#xD;
A uniform national enforcement case management solution is required and must:&#xD;
1.	Be available within time and budget constraints provided by TBS.&#xD;
2.	Ensure that information collected in an investigation is stored and tracked in such a way as to be suitable for use in any case brought to court. &#xD;
3.	Ensure that information collected in an investigation is controlled such that only authorized individuals may have access (Jarvis and Ling (2002)).&#xD;
4.	Ensure that the manner in which information is collected, stored, and reported on is consistent nationally and reports are readily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
The estimated project completion date for the recommended option is December 2022 with the solution being available to support the Beta testing starting in June 2021 and full production availability by March 2022 at a total cost estimate of 2.8 million dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
ISB is seeking the approval from Director General Project Oversight Committee (DGPOC) to proceed to stage 2/3 – Initiation and Planning with the recommended solution of selecting a third-party vendor product that is specialized in the Enforcement workspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
ISB needs a solution to address the following key challenges:&#xD;
•	National consistency of information contained in the system&#xD;
•	Control over the information maintained in the system, keeping an audit trail on evidence contained such that its utility in court proceedings is assured&#xD;
•	Elevated risk of securing data across diverse case systems&#xD;
•	Compatibility with external agencies &#xD;
•	National standards for reporting and quality monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enforcement function is in need of an effective case management system capable of supporting effective workload management, unified case management, the release of quality court documents, tracking of evidence and reporting. The Office of the Auditor General (OAG), in its 2017 spring report “Managing the Risk of Fraud”, noted the following “fraud in a federal government organization can cause the loss of public money or property, hurt employee morale, and undermine Canadians’ confidence in public services. Therefore, federal organizations must manage their fraud risks.”1 The lack of an effective case management system within ISB is limiting the ability of ISB to support robust investigations and achieve ESDC strategic objectives. &#xD;
In 2016, ISB completed an audit of the enforcement function that was executed by former Canada Revenu Agency (CRA) executive Dennis Meunier. This audit resulted in what has been termed the Meunier Report. The Meunier report provides 44 recommendations to ISB on how to improve the enforcement function and a related project – Enforcement as a Practice (EaaP) has been started to implement these improvements. The EaaP project has scheduled a Beta trial starting on June 7, 2021 and has requested that the electronic solution be in place so the software and new processes can be validated together.&#xD;
Finally, an internal audit conducted by ISB in 2014 highlighted that the results of investigations could be better leveraged to strengthen program integrity and prevention measures. In addition, mechanisms are required to support the alignment of regional investigative practices to national standards for the consistent treatment of all Canadians. The legacy case management systems in use today were not designed to enable statistical or data analysis of the case data, including results of investigations, thus severely limiting the ability of ISB to detect fraud trends and other anomalies that could have otherwise been used to strengthen fraud prevention. &#xD;
1 Office of the Auditor General of Canada (OAG), Managing the Risk of Fraud, Report 1 in Reports of the Auditor General of Canada – Spring 2017, para. 1.1.  &#xD;
The lack of a case management system for the Enforcement function under ISB, inconsistent case management, and the outdated legacy and manual systems used by the branch for EI, CPP, and OAS, provide an opportunity to improve the way that ISB manages its investigations. A new, modern case management system will improve workload and quality management, allow for the tracking of evidence, support real-time reporting and give ESDC the ability to better leverage its investigation data in support of enforcement activities.</documentation>

2.3.1 Business Environment&#xD;
ISB maintains trust by ensuring that ESDC protects the integrity of programs, services, people and assets, and that costly errors, abuse and fraud are prevented, detected and managed.&#xD;
To fulfill its mission, Integrity Operations investigates allegations of non-eligibility and non-entitlement to benefits, investigates potential SIN fraud, investigates EI fraud, and detects and refers for investigation pension fraud. Fraud detection is enhanced by the application of data analysis and predicative analytics to reconstruct or detect fraud schemes. This requires data collection, data preparation, data analysis and then the creation of the necessary compliance or enforcement reports through intelligence analysis.</documentation>

Enterprise Architecture Framework&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework is the criteria used by the Government of Canada enterprise architecture review board and departmental architecture review boards when reviewing digital initiatives to ensure their alignment with enterprise architectures across business, information, application, technology and security domains to support strategic outcomes. The EA Framework came into effect on December 1, 2020 and is a replacement of Appendix A, Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment from the Directive on Service and Digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework provide details on the requirements set out in the following sections of the Policy and Directive on Service and Digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.2.3 of the Policy on Service and Digital. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Canada is responsible for: Prescribing expectations with regard to enterprise architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.2.4 of the Policy on Service and Digital. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Canada is responsible for: Establishing and chairing an enterprise architecture review board that is mandated to define current and target architecture standards for the Government of Canada and review departmental proposals for alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.1.1 of the Directive on Service and Digital. The departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for: Chairing a departmental architecture review board that is mandated to review and approve the architecture of all departmental digital initiatives and ensure their alignment with enterprise architectures.&#xD;

&#xD;
Proposed to BDM-ARC for endorsement (1-5 out of 10)&#xD;
1) BDM will implement a new Target Operating Model designed for the future. Transition will be gradual and iterative ensuring service continuity.&#xD;
2) BDM will consume a GC or ESDC enterprise solution/service where it exists and meets all BDM mandatory and majority of non-mandatory functional and non-functional requirements, as well as, when there is a commitment and plan for long-term investment in sustainment and support.&#xD;
3) BDM will favour investment in strategic solutions and technologies over investment in interim and tactical ones. &#xD;
4) Data is at the center of BDM. BDM embraces Data Management-by-design by building services and processes that support and enable appropriate data access, standards and quality for ESDC clients, partners and staff. BDM advocates leveraging data from an authoritative source. &#xD;
5) Digital First. BDM will design and implement digital interfaces to enable and encourage submission of information in a digital format through the digital channel and third-party systems and end-user applications.&#xD;
6) Open solutions by default, proprietary by exception. SaaS and COTS that support open standards are considered open solutions. Open source will be considered where appropriate. &#xD;
7) Balance Service and Security. Balance proactive and personalized Service Experience and Privacy.&#xD;
8) BDM will embed integrity and quality controls up-front and throughout processes and services. &#xD;
9) Cloud First. BDM will leverage cloud where appropriate and available.&#xD;
10) Minimize changes and write-back to legacy.</documentation>

      <documentation>Context: a rapidly changing digital landscape&#xD;
Today’s digital landscape is marked by change of unprecedented pace and scope. Rapid technological, digital and data transformation are now part of Canadians’ daily lives, revolutionizing the way they access information and services and the way they live, socialize and work.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians expect to be able to access any government service, at any time and on any device. Most citizens agree that personal information should be shared between GC departments to enable faster, more accurate service.Footnote2 However, while they recognize the potential of technological, digital and data transformation, citizens are concerned about how the GC uses and manages their personal information and about what it does to ensure their privacy and security.Footnote3&#xD;
&#xD;
In the 2020 Speech from the Throne, the government committed to ensuring that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed Internet. It also committed to making generational investments to update outdated IT systems to modernize the way government serves Canadians, from the elderly to the young, and from people looking for work to those living with a disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada plays a leadership role on digital government internationally, through forums such as the Digital Nations, the International Council for Information Technology in Government Administration (ICA), the Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development (OECD), and the United Nations.&#xD;
&#xD;
In recent years, Canada has also emerged as a leading voice in the global open government community. Since 2012, it has been a member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP). This multilateral initiative by 75 member nations and a number of sub‑national government members aims to secure concrete commitments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance, in partnership with civil society and the private sector. So far, Canada has released three OGP action plans outlining how it will make government more open. A fourth action plan is under development.&#xD;
&#xD;
The world is moving toward using cleaner technologies. The 2021–2024 DOSP goes hand in hand with the Greening Government Strategy, which seeks to make GC operations low-carbon through green procurement and clean technologies.</documentation>

Government of Canada Digital Standards: Playbook&#xD;
From Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat&#xD;
&#xD;
Improving government services in the Digital Age&#xD;
Our goal is to provide public services to Canadians which are simple to use and trustworthy. The Government of Canada’s Digital Standards form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
These digital standards were co-created with the public and key stakeholder groups. They are living standards and they will continue to evolve over time as we better understand the complexities involved in putting them into practice.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Design With Users" id="id-d83c9e1b9d57424fb062d7c8473d4174">
      <documentation>Design with users&#xD;
Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Design with users&#xD;
Services should not be built based on internal constraints or complexities of government, they should be built to address the needs of users. In order to deliver value to users, one must understand and prioritize their needs. Everything is a hypothesis until tested with the users of services.&#xD;
&#xD;
To validate one's hypotheses, one must validate their assumptions through direct and frequent interactions with those who will be using the services. Users may be members of the public, or government employees or a combination thereof. Keeping in mind that users will come from diverse backgrounds, varying in location, experience, knowledge, and abilities, requirements for services are built first and foremost with the needs of all users. When designing services, one must take a holistic approach to service delivery -- from each member's individual contributions to the end goal, as defined by user requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. End-user feedback is used to establish the requirements of our service(s).&#xD;
2. Our team has processes or tools in place for user feedback, including anonymous user feedback, to be incorporated into the design of the service.&#xD;
3. Our team conducts user research prior to deciding upon a given implementation. &#xD;
4. Our team has tested our primary systems in the users’ context with a wide range of users including users with varying needs and representing diverse backgrounds.&#xD;
5. Our team considers user needs and feedback in defining key service metrics.&#xD;
6. Our team uses automation to anticipate and detect operational or quality-of-service issues before our users tell us.&#xD;
7. Our team has within it, or direct access to, the expertise required to conduct user research and usability testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team receives requirements through extensive documentation and builds against them.&#xD;
2. Our team does not involve internal or external users to collaborate on the design of the service.&#xD;
3. The technical development resources or IT senior management are prioritizing features.&#xD;
4. Our team's prioritization of tasks is driven by senior management.&#xD;
5. Senior executives and teams rely exclusively on desk-based research, or other proxy sources of information to inform policy, program and/or service design.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Iterate and Improve Frequently" id="id-a4997127d9494b4f90284ee93b5286a1">
      <documentation>Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
In contrast to high risk and long lead time ‘big bang’ deployments, working services must be put in the hands of users as early as possible to get rapid feedback. Said feedback is then used to iterate upon to improve the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
One sets a north star to define a clear direction, then begins iterating towards this north star, keeping in mind that the path is not clear, and unexpected circumstances will require adjustments to be made along the way. By leveraging modern technologies and modern approaches to working, risk can be reduced by limiting the size of changes and increasing their frequency. Processes should empower teams to deliver value to services as often as possible, rather than increase risk by creating prolonged processes that use documentation in place of demonstrably functioning software. Focus on working software over comprehensive documentation and remember that perfect is the enemy of good.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. There are processes in place to prioritize and implement feedback from peers, stakeholders and end-users.&#xD;
2. When a new or updated service or feature is being created our team understands the minimum requirements for the system to be of value to users.&#xD;
3. Our team experiments with new approaches based on team reflections, lessons learned, and user feedback.&#xD;
4. Our team collects metrics to improve upon which are used throughout the development and lifecycle of the service.&#xD;
5. When resolving problems our team dedicates time to identify the root cause of the issue and address it.&#xD;
6. Our team is relentlessly inspecting, adapting, and automating their processes to increase the speed at which our team can deliver value to users.&#xD;
7. Our team has access to environments and resources to allow for rapid prototyping while initial requirements are being sought.&#xD;
8. Our team embraces learning about and using new digital skills, approaches, and tools to incorporate into our daily work.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team only shares their work once it has been finalized and approved.&#xD;
2. Decisions regarding the direction of our team are made without reference to any collected performance metrics.&#xD;
3. Our team identifies solutions before it is clear what outcomes our team is working towards and how to measure them.&#xD;
4. Processes are rarely, if ever, reviewed to find and implement efficiencies.&#xD;
5. Our team must wait for the project to be approved and funded prior to environments being made available to teams to begin experimenting with solutions.&#xD;
6. Our team fully architects the end to the service delivery solution prior to starting to build.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Work In The Open By Default" id="id-952813b57dd54e33bd0d8f43a01660f9">
      <documentation>Work in the open by default&#xD;
Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Work in the open by default&#xD;
Working in the open increases the transparency of services, increases trust in government, creates an ecosystem that promotes innovation, prevents needing to reinvent the wheel by increasing collaboration within, and external to, government. Working in the open promotes understanding of government processes and services and creates an environment whereby innovation can take place throughout the Government of Canada and through non-governmental organizations leveraging the government data and information to improve service delivery for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
This way of working aligns Canada with the Digital Nations Charter, of which it is a signatory and promotes “transparency and citizen participation and uses open licences to produce and consume open data”, and the Open Data Charter. Further, by working in the open the Government of Canada can increase its reuse of existing public solutions and allow others to reuse work conducted by the Government of Canada. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Teams continually makes all non-sensitive and non-personal data, information, and new code publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, for sharing and reuse.&#xD;
2. Our team contributes back to the public projects from which they borrow content.&#xD;
3. Our team tracks and makes public the metrics upon which our team measures its success.&#xD;
4. Our team tracks, and makes publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, information regarding how often a change to our services fails (e.g., the deployment or rollout of a service or feature experiences issues or complications).&#xD;
5. Our team makes visual displays which show what they’re working on and the status of their work available publicly, or at least throughout the Government of Canada.&#xD;
6. Our team publicly documents, including examples of reuse, how others can use their service’s APIs, open data, or information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. All of the team's work is done on systems behind the corporate firewall.&#xD;
2. The work of our team has permissions set so that only members of our team can access the team's work.&#xD;
3. Our team does not contribute to, or collaborate on, work being done by our colleagues.&#xD;
4. Team applies blanket security classification for the digital system to all data stored by the application.&#xD;
5. Our team has no process by which to declassify and release records when they are no longer protected or classified.&#xD;
6. The documentation for our APIs is only available to internal approved consumers.</documentation>

Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices, including the use of open source software where appropriate. Design for services and platforms that are seamless for Canadians to use no matter what device or channel they are using.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Use open standards and solutions&#xD;
To maintain the trust of Canadians, the government must continually learn and improve by embracing leading practices to simplify access to government services to match the rising expectations of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
In alignment with the Digital Nations Charter, which calls for both the use of Open Standards and Open Source, this Digital Standard aligns with the ultimate Digital Vision which reads, “The Government of Canada is an open and service-oriented organization that operates and delivers programs and services to people and businesses in simple, modern and effective ways that are optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere and from any device.” By leveraging open source software, and leveraging open standards and solutions, the Government of Canada can mitigate vendor lock-in and expand its vendor pool from which to acquire digital services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team prioritizes solutions using open standards over solutions that do not.&#xD;
2. Team members give back to the open source community as active contributors.&#xD;
3. Our team designs their services to be interoperable with other services.&#xD;
4. When searching for a new product, service or solution, our team considers open source solutions.&#xD;
5. Our team supports clients using any device, from anywhere and at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team renews existing contracts with vendors without first investigating open source tooling.&#xD;
2. Our team does not have the competencies within it to deliver its services without the help of consultants or closed source vendor software.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Address Security and Privacy Risks" id="id-6987c7026ba2476ca8612f7b42893903">
      <documentation>Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. Make security measures frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Digital services are core to service delivery, and they must securely store and manage the information of Canadians to maintain trust in government services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Security and privacy should be taken as a consideration from the onset of work for a given service, in alignment with Iterate and Improve. The implementation of security and privacy controls should be considered part of daily work. Similarly, processes should promote and monitor the continuous implementation of security and privacy controls throughout the lifecycle of a service. This will demonstrably increase the security and privacy posture of digital services by leveraging automated testing and real time reporting and monitoring over anecdotal document-heavy manual processes. Said processes, and the security and privacy controls themselves, should be frictionless, ensuring that services are designed first and foremost for users, not to satisfy existing legacy government procedures, tooling, or processes. Furthermore, by creating frictionless processes and permitting services to be iterated and improved upon quickly, the government is better situated to respond quickly to security or privacy risk. By responding to these operational needs within hours or minutes rather than months, the government can improve its security and privacy posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team considers security and privacy throughout the service design process.&#xD;
2. When implementing or enforcing security or privacy controls, our team takes into consideration how they would impact the quality or efficiency of the service and how it will impact the end users of the service.&#xD;
3. Security measures are frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
4. Our team has privacy and security knowledge and understanding as a competency within the team.&#xD;
5. The service has implemented automated security checks and privacy protections include role-based access and audit functions against the service.&#xD;
6. There are procedures and processes in place to quickly respond to security or privacy breaches or incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Team has no internal privacy or security knowledge, relying on other teams to identify nearly all security or privacy controls and best practices.&#xD;
2. The core services upon which our team works have no automated security checks or privacy protections.&#xD;
3. Our team relies on security through obscurity, hiding services or information rather than improving the security posture of the service.&#xD;
4. Our team implements or enforces security or privacy controls without considering the impact on service usability.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Build In Accessibility From the Start" id="id-c534f2e4013049c397f87db7dab23534">
      <documentation>Build in accessibility from the start&#xD;
Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Build in accessibility from the start&#xD;
Quality should be built in from the start, preventing the need to revisit previously implemented components due to issues, such as accessibility. The faster and earlier issues are found the less costly they are to fix.&#xD;
&#xD;
Accessibility in Canada is about creating communities, workplaces and services that enable everyone to participate fully in society without barriers. The Government of Canada is committed to taking a proactive and systemic approach for identifying, removing and preventing barriers to accessibility without delay complementing the rights of persons with disabilities under the Canadian Human Rights Act. To meet these commitments, accessibility should be a consideration throughout the service development lifecycle. This requires that accessibility be monitored and built into our processes to continually promote alignment with accessibility standards. While iterating and improving frequently and designing with users, accessibility should be a key consideration, and become a source of work items throughout the service design lifecycle. When designing with users, efforts should be made to identify a wide variety of users with a wide variety of needs, to ensure accessibility standards are met or exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Starting at the outset, our team's service and platform design continually considers the lowest levels of digital skill, confidence and access.&#xD;
2. Our team understands how to make their services or products accessible.&#xD;
3. Our team considers accessibility throughout the service design process.&#xD;
4. Research and testing are conducted to ensure our service is accessible to people of all abilities no matter how, where, or when they access the service.&#xD;
5. Our team conducts ongoing user research with users with low level digital literacy, people with disability, and people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.&#xD;
6. Our team implements automated accessibility checks for our services.&#xD;
&#xD;

      <documentation>Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
Make sure that staff have access to the tools, training and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build and operation of the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
To promote innovation and create agility within our organizations the teams that makeup our organizations must be empowered. Innovation increasingly flows from the bottom up rather than from the top down, and to benefit from this trend teams must be empowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Don’t hire good people to tell them what to do, hire good people to have them tell you what to do. The government manages large, highly complex and crucially important services for their users. A top-down command and control approach to service delivery and designs enforces a structure that aligns to the structure itself, rather than to the needs of the users, or based on the expertise of those building the services. Rather than bringing information to authority, bring authority to the information. Those best suited to solve a given problem, are those closest to the problem. By removing decision-making authority from the teams into complex governance structures, the innovative potential of teams is mitigated by legacy governance procedures and processes. To create organizations that can iterate and improve frequently, teams must be empowered to make decisions for themselves. Complex architectures that are responsive to the needs of users, including users within the organization, are emergent and are not derived through the compilation of hypotheses lacking the expertise of those closest to the complex problems needing to be solved. &#xD;
&#xD;

      <documentation>Be good data stewards&#xD;
Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held in a secure way so that it can easily be reused by others to provide services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Be good data stewards&#xD;
Good data stewardship is required to ensure data is clean, reusable, and managed responsibly to be leveraged for data driven decision making and promote reuse of information rather than duplication of efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
This involves managing data and information responsibly and securely, which supports the sharing and reuse of data throughout the Government of Canada and through promoting its use through innovative new solutions within the private sector. In alignment with working in the open by default, data and information should be published to be readable, by humans or by machines by publishing well organized data in machine readable formats. In alignment with iterating and improving frequently, efforts should be made to continually improve the quality of the data, and the quality of the processes used to manage and publish said data. Further, by working in the open by default and properly managing data and information sources, issues such as duplication of data and information and rework can be mitigated, while promoting the creation of innovative solutions which are able to leverage information collected and published by the government. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team strives to leverage data to continuously improve decision-making, operations, or service delivery.&#xD;

      <documentation>Design ethical services&#xD;
Make sure that everyone receives fair treatment. Comply with ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems which automate decision making (such as the use of artificial intelligence).&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Design ethical services&#xD;
Designing ethical systems means that systems created by the government ensures that everyone receives equitable treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Services should address client needs and provide public benefits. In the digital age, the underlying systems that run Canada’s services come to conclusions that can be opaque to both the external users, and those managing the systems. Efforts are required to increase the transparency and address potential biases of computational decisions, and to ensure that decisions made or supported using these systems are legal, consistent, accurate and align with the expectations and intents of those managing them. The responsible use of automated-decision systems includes being open about their use and being able to explain how decisions are made. Through iterative service design where results are continuously monitored against expected and desired outcomes, the organization positions itself to ensure it is designing ethical services. Furthermore, with extensive monitoring solutions, one must ensure their services are not enforcing biases, whether conscious or unconscious. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team continually seeks out indicators of bias and ensures their services are not reinforcing unintended biases.&#xD;
2. Our team continually seeks out evidence of unintended consequences to the user in service design and delivery and works to mitigate these consequences for the user.&#xD;
3. When automated decision-making is being leveraged by our team, possible biases in the data and algorithms are acknowledged, accounted for, and mitigated.&#xD;
4. Our team designs services which address cultural, linguistic, geographical, disability, technological, socioeconomic, or other access barriers to uptake.&#xD;
5. Our team has considered the impacts of decisions on the users and negative outcomes are reduced, when encountered.&#xD;
6. Our team uses data in a manner consistent with the purpose of its collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. No training is provided to our team regarding the potential impacts of the service they are designing or delivering.&#xD;
2. Our team conducts little to no monitoring of outcomes of the service to identify implicit bias.&#xD;
3. Our team delegates ethical analysis to a vendor or external service, without direct accountability to management.&#xD;
4. Our team designs and deliver services without fully considering relevant legislation&#xD;
5. Our team delivers services without assessing the impacts of negative outcomes.</documentation>

      <documentation>Collaborate widely&#xD;
Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Collaborate widely&#xD;
Collaborating widely allows us to learn from others to minimize mistakes already experienced and reduces work through identifying and sharing existing solutions. The problems that government solves are often unique, though they are not unique amongst governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Many of the same solutions by the same, or similar vendors, are used throughout the world, or at varying levels of government within different jurisdictions. When designing a service, or implementing a service using tools or systems, identify which other departments, jurisdictions, or organizations, have leveraged similar technologies to solve similar use cases in order to collaborate widely, reduce work, share solutions, and benefit from lessons already learned by others. Furthermore, using multidisciplinary teams, especially when coupled with the empowerment of staff, the government improves its posture to deliver modern and innovative services. Through wide collaboration, organizations begin to break down the silos developed over time through the overreliance on functionally based teams. Going forward, working across skill sets, and leveraging work from others, while learning from their lessons, promotes the development of modern services better able to meet the changing needs of citizens in the digital age.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team is multidisciplinary, having all the skills and capabilities required to fully deliver our service to users.&#xD;
2. Our team is active in communities of practice, events, or groups that pertain to the areas of expertise of team members.&#xD;
3. Our team has identified, and collaborates with, other teams, in or outside of our organisation, including other levels of government, other governments, the public, or private sector organizations, who have done, or are doing, similar work.&#xD;
4. Our team documents any APIs for our service using modern and common protocols and standards and provides examples to others regarding their use.&#xD;
5. Our team uses data from performance monitoring tools to inform business decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team develops most of the service on our own, without leveraging existing solutions and services to reduce duplication of effort.&#xD;
2. Our team overwhelmingly relies on tickets to manage collaboration between internal stakeholders or teams.&#xD;
3. The team does not consider the impacts on teams working across the value stream, or on the outcome of the service.</documentation>

Name:	Accessibility&#xD;
Statement:	ESDC services are accessible on an equitable basis to clients&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Government services needs to be accessible to the widest set of consumers. Channel independence ensures that clients have a choice of access options. While information and services need to be accessed in a variety of ways, the information and services must be delivered in an integrated, consistent fashion.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Services should be designed to operate consistently across multiple delivery channels.&#xD;
•	Programs will need to resource significant additional effort in human interface design.&#xD;
•	In designing services, programs will need to consider accessibility by, and interoperability with, automated services.&#xD;

      <documentation>3.3.	Value&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Value&#xD;
Statement:	Government business initiatives and investments must represent value for money and return a business benefit.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The value and cost of investments need to be measurable in objective terms. A government service that does not have an understood return on investment (ROI) is unlikely to receive the on-going support and commitment that will make it sustainable.&#xD;
•	Service delivery can create complicated cost/benefit models, particularly where there are cross-jurisdictional boundaries. The benefits realized through a service may not be recorded by the program and/or programs that are required to invest. A thorough understanding of the costs and benefits is required to establish an appropriate investment model to support the creation and on-going management of the service.&#xD;
•	It is mandatory for programs to meet the GC procurement rules for:&#xD;
    o	 value for money,&#xD;
    o	 encouraging competition,&#xD;
    o	efficient, effective and ethical use of resources, and&#xD;
    o	accountability and transparency.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Business initiatives will need to be fit for purpose and deliver value and benefit.&#xD;
•	Business initiatives will need to be prioritized in terms of their relation to the GC and department vision, policies, strategies and plans.&#xD;
•	The department will need to assess the ROI for each business initiative.&#xD;
•	Public ROI should be based on the department taking a rewards-based approach to ROI measurement and encompass the following three areas:&#xD;
    o	Financial ROI:  Traditional or “classic” measurement of financial gains with quantifiable results. These ROI is direct, measureable benefits and costs e.g., reduced transaction costs (such as in procurement by reducing the cost creating a purchase order from $28 to $21) or fewer steps in the workflow of approving a budget request&#xD;
    o	Social ROI:  Impact of government services on a societal level This ROI is indirect and difficult to measure public good benefits and costs e.g., are citizens safer? Are children in a particular jurisdiction receiving adequate social services? Are the vulnerable receiving sufficient support?&#xD;
    o	Political ROI: Impacts the system of governing and policy decision making. This ROI is motivational feasibility of the project, or the benefits of interested parties (champions, opponents, decision makers) e.g., are we delivering government programs that match policies, legislation and mandates? Are we delivering on the promises of our politicians?&#xD;
•	In addition to assessing the public ROI for each business initiative, a total cost of ownership (TCO) approach will be required. The TCO will need to assess the investment against other priorities, as well as balancing the costs of development, support, security, risk mitigation, disaster recovery and retirement against the costs of government’s requirements for flexibility, scalability, ease of use and reduction of integration complexity.&#xD;
•	There will need to be improved whole-of-government usage of business benefit management and benchmarking,&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Reliable&#xD;
Statement:	Departmental services are reliable, accurate, relevant and timely.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The take-up and use of lower cost channels will depend on users of government services trusting the ability of the government to provide reliable, accurate, relevant and timely information to consumers.&#xD;
•	Reliable services that provide consistent outcomes will help to reduce complaints, reviews and appeals from consumers.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	The department  will need to deliver services and information which clients can rely upon. &#xD;
•	 The department, and  programs will need to devote effort towards service design and service performance management to ensure reliable services&#xD;
•	Good processes create good services and data. Processes will need to be the focus of ongoing continuous improvement (which in turn will improve reliability, accuracy, relevancy and timeliness of the service). &#xD;
•	 The department will need to provide trusted services and information to individuals, and organizations. The outcomes of these services and information will strengthened the trust in the department and Government of Canada. &#xD;
•	The department and programs will  need to collaboration  with other departments and programs to deliver, manage and measure services to ensure the services are achieving the desired outcomes&#xD;

      <documentation>3.5.	Cohesiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Cohesiveness&#xD;
Statement:	Departments shall present a consistent and unified face of government through a common and integrated approach to service delivery.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Government services are presented to clients in a consistent and cohesive manner. This means that clients of government services should only need to present a piece of information to government once. Similarly, clients will be presented with a common look, feel and experience regardless of what department service or channel they are accessing at the time. This presentation of a consistent government face will reduce the impact of internal government change (for example, department/program amalgamations and restructures) on clients, and potentially reduce the flow on costs of such changes. Adoption and continued use of a service by clients will depend, to an extent, on ease of use enhanced by consistency of service delivery.&#xD;
•	With the introduction of common services and the reduction of duplicate services, the Government/Department has the opportunity to reduce costs.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Departments and Programs will need to collaborate in the development of services. This will require open sharing of information, cross-department/program planning, and understanding of whole-of-government service channels, segments and lines of business.&#xD;
•	To achieve consistent and interoperable service across the whole-of-government, the government, department and its programs will need to agree and use common technologies, open industry standards and open architectures.&#xD;
•	The department and programs will need to align service delivery with whole-of-government policies, strategies and frameworks.&#xD;
•	Departments and programs will need to reduce integration complexity.&#xD;
•	Departments and programs will need to incorporate the seamless use of interoperable applications, data and information across various sourcing models and operating environments.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Accessible-by-Default&#xD;
&#xD;
Statement:	Information and data is open, accessible and easy to use by default, however protected within closed environments when it includes personally identify  and/or sensitive data &#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The Government of Canada strives to provide Canadians with access to the data that is produced, collected, and used by departments and agencies across the federal government through a single and searchable window.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are easily findable and consumable, in the appropriate format for a variety of users and scenarios.&#xD;
•	Benefits of open data include:&#xD;
    o	Support for innovation&#xD;
    o	Advancing the government's accountability and democratic reform &#xD;
    o	Leveraging public sector information to develop consumer and commercial products &#xD;
    o	Better use of existing investment in broadband and community information infrastructure &#xD;
    o	Support for research &#xD;
    o	Support informed decisions for clients &#xD;
    o	Proactive Disclosure&#xD;
•	Information and Data are ubiquitous, but to be of business value the constraints challenging its access and use must be mitigated as much as is appropriate to do so. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Unless sensitive or containing personally identifiable data, the data is accessible to all employees of ESDC.&#xD;
•	When designing services and systems, opportunities for publishing open data must be explored. Data can be published in different formats, or made accessible through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). &#xD;
•	Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide on-demand access to large, timely or complex data.&#xD;
•	Information and Data holdings must be aligned to business needs and functions.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are clearly catalogued, easily discoverable and easily accessible.&#xD;
•	Access must be closely tied to understanding of the data, otherwise inappropriate use may occur.&#xD;
•	Information and Data consumers’ awareness and education of data sources must be sustained.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are in the appropriate tool and format for use and users know how to access it.&#xD;
•	Efficient / timely access to information / data and its protection are not mutually exclusive concepts.&#xD;
•	Information and Data repositories need to be managed to reduce redundancies and duplication.&#xD;
•	Information and Data presentation must match generally accepted internal or external standards.&#xD;
•	Levels of aggregation or disaggregation are appropriate for consumption purposes.&#xD;
•	Timeliness of access permits the right data to be available when it is needed.&#xD;
•	Mashup of Information and Data will push the boundaries of user understanding and will need training and support.&#xD;
•	Knowledge repositories should capture enterprise information in ways to be useful as a basis for designing programs and services to improve future outcomes.&#xD;
•	Business and Information Professionals must partner to ensure user/consumer perspective is enabled.&#xD;
•	Information and data is now found in many forms and under many constraints.&#xD;
•	Boundaries or constraints can include legal, geographic, ownership, sovereignty, language, format, application, technology, security, privacy, etc.; the goal is to architect by considering these boundaries, not to circumvent them.&#xD;
•	Data architecture or lineage and flow must be such that we can utilize, process, and share data regardless of constraints.&#xD;
•	Data if possible should reside where it is and not re-created or moved.&#xD;
•	Intellectual property must be respected and maintained regardless of constraints.&#xD;
•	A federated management / stewardship approach may be applied in certain circumstances.&#xD;
•	Availability must not suffer due to insufficiently designed and implemented solutions.&#xD;
•	Third party processing (supply chain security) policies and architectures should be designed and monitored (i.e., our data must be under our rules at all times and locations).&#xD;

      <documentation>4.2.	Common Understanding and Trusted&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Common Understanding and Trusted&#xD;
Statement:	Business and program terminology and data are defined consistently throughout the Department, and the definitions and values are understandable, trusted and available to all users.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	A common vocabulary facilitates communications and enables effective dialogue.&#xD;
•	The data that will be used in the development of services must have a common definition throughout the Department to enable sharing of data. &#xD;
•	Information and Data are meaningfully defined from an enterprise perspective by the appropriate authorities, and are obtained from reliable, authoritative and understood data flows and sources. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	The Department must establish the initial common vocabulary for the business based on open standards where available. The definitions will be used uniformly throughout the Department.&#xD;
•	Multiple concurrent definitions must be replaced by a definition that is accepted and understood by the entire Department.&#xD;
•	Whenever a new definition is required, the definition effort will be co-coordinated and reconciled with the corporate &quot;glossary&quot;. &#xD;
•	Clarity and integrity of information / data is crucial to supporting business processes&#xD;
•	Building trust in data requires a multi-faceted approach.&#xD;
•	Metadata capture and utilisation must be mandatory in all processes and systems&#xD;
•	Data and its associated metadata must be an integral part of any business process design&#xD;
•	Information and data lineage (flow) and applied business rules must be documented and available&#xD;
•	Stewards must clearly define business terms and data elements, aligned to business programs to provide a common enterprise vocabulary, thus allowing for enterprise-wide use and interoperability&#xD;
•	Stewards need a simple and repeatable process to define, have approved and publish definitions and other metadata for information and data elements&#xD;
•	Stewards and all consumers need a repository, tied to important systems to capture / consume metadata &#xD;
•	Stewards will direct custodians in their activities as relates data aspects&#xD;
•	Properly identified data custodians are solely responsible for data capture to ensure integrity and quality and reduce redundant efforts and storage/processing&#xD;
•	Data governance and stewardship provide the means to ensure that enterprise data can be trusted &#xD;
•	Enterprise Information and Data should be located in authoritative sources &#xD;
•	Without trust in data consumers may develop their own siloed and redundant solutions/repositories.&#xD;

      <documentation>4.3.	Shared Assets&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Shared Assets&#xD;
Statement:	Information and Data are Shared Assets.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are valuable enterprise assets, with clear accountability, and treated as ‘our’ data not ‘my’ data to fully deliver on its benefits. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Information / Data are enterprise assets, much like capital, human or intellectual property assets.&#xD;
•	Most enterprise assets require careful management, and Information / Data are no exception.&#xD;
•	Information / Data assets exist to respond to business needs, support decision-making, enhance operational efficiencies and provide effective service delivery.&#xD;
•	Ownership resides at the enterprise level or higher, not at the individual or business line level.&#xD;
•	Clearly assigned stewardship is key to managing day-to-day data activities and data quality but requires the authority and the means to do so to ensure authoritative decisions are taken by the right parties.&#xD;
•	Discussion and decision forums and approaches must be inclusive, transparent, holistic and at the enterprise level and no longer strictly by business line or limited scope.&#xD;
•	Value is derived from sharing by reducing the number of authoritative sources, obliging data quality, permitting horizontal use / re-use and aggregation / dissemination to tap into unknown potential, and by allowing faster yet secured access.&#xD;
•	Managing and sharing requires policies, procedures, standards, roles &amp; responsibilities, to govern data management capabilities and a significant cultural change at all enterprise levels.&#xD;
•	Various artefacts and tools such as an enterprise data model and a business glossary will assist with management, communication and sharing in support of the enterprise mandate.&#xD;

Name:	Fit-for-Purpose&#xD;
Statement:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are Fit-for-Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are suitable and of the appropriate quality for the intended purpose, as defined by the business programs and tested as close to the source as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Often assumed to be a 100% data quality requirement and not the pragmatic reality.&#xD;
•	Approach should be to get the data ‘right’ for the need, as defined by the responsible party.&#xD;
•	Management and architecture of the information / data must support not only operational needs but also and analytical / research and marketing requirements, otherwise the data has no value in bettering program outcomes.&#xD;
•	Information and Data quality must be tested and remediated as close to the source as possible.&#xD;
•	Information and Data quality will degrade over time, even if nothing ‘happens’ to the actual data, therefore validation of its quality must be performed as an ongoing function, not one-time efforts and monitoring and reporting on quality metrics must be part of everyday operations.&#xD;
•	Data quality functional expertise (i.e., center of excellence) can establish a standardised framework and support to business programs in their quality validation processes.&#xD;
•	Dimensions of quality utilised to validate the appropriateness and usefulness of the data will vary by necessity (i.e., uniqueness, validity, completeness, accuracy, etc.).&#xD;
•	Business purpose of data must consider upstream and downstream uses, and not just the immediate use.&#xD;
•	Information and data repositories may need differing levels of quality if utilised for research versus operational needs.&#xD;

Rationale:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are managed across all data management capabilities and throughout its lifecycle, according to industry standards and best practices, for the purpose of answering current and future business needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Data Management Functional leadership must exist to ensure all aspects of managing information and data are included to cover all facets of business data needs.&#xD;
•	Functional leadership must create and ensure their standards are applied and monitored for conformity. &#xD;
•	Interoperability is the target, and integration is the interim solution, to avoid data silos, replication and unnecessary processing and movement.&#xD;
•	Managing Information and data is often a collaborative effort between data professionals and business professionals.&#xD;
•	Measuring the maturity of information and data management practices is of value to ensure improvements and alignment to business needs.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name: 	Buy what we can and build what we must.&#xD;
Statement:&#xD;
Implement cloud services/COTS by default, open source where practical, and reserve custom development for unique requirements; adopt shared services and common government solutions where available.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Procuring commercial solutions (Cloud Services, COTS or open source) for common applications allows ESDC to focus its resources on application with Unique Requirements related specific configurations, customizations, and as a last resort custom development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	When deploying new workloads, Departments must consider cloud service models in the following order:&#xD;
    o	Cloud Services (SaaS)&#xD;
    o	Open source&#xD;
    o	COTS &#xD;
This means that the preference will be given to subscribing to SaaS solutions rather than buying or developing new solutions that can be hosted on a PaaS or IaaS infrastructure.&#xD;
•	When SaaS is not available, ESDC will explore availability of packaged solutions, both commercially available (COTS) and open source. Only if no appropriate solution is available on the market (commercial or open sauce), development of a custom solution would be considered.&#xD;
•	Proprietary solutions restrict reuse, reduce asset management flexibility and can prevent government organizations from switching suppliers.&#xD;
•	Open source will be fairly assessed against proprietary solutions alternatives. Exit, rebid and rebuild costs will be taken into consideration during procurement decisions for best value for money comparisons between open source and proprietary solutions.&#xD;

Name: 	Service Orientation&#xD;
Statement:	The architecture is based on a design of services which mirror real-world business activities comprising the enterprise (or inter-enterprise) business processes.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Service orientation supports enterprise agility and boundaryless information flow&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;

•	Service representation utilizes business description to provide context (i.e. business process, goal, rule, policy service interface and service component) and implements services using service orchestration&#xD;
•	Service orientation places unique requirements on the infrastructure; implementations should use open standards to realise interoperability and location transparency.&#xD;
•	Implementations are environment specific; they are constrained by context and must be described within that context.&#xD;
•	Service orientation requires strong governance of service representation and implementation.&#xD;

Statement:	‘Right-size’ the variety of technology platforms to use in alignment with our partners’ strategic choices (i.e. SSC, TBS).&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Limiting the number of different supported technologies:&#xD;
    o	Improves maintainability and reduces total cost of ownership.&#xD;
    o	Enhances staff focus on standardized technologies and reduces staff competency requirements.&#xD;
    o	Improves solution interoperability&#xD;

Implications:&#xD;
•	Consider benefits of introducing a new technology versus the required additional maintenance effort, additional staff competency requirements, increased complexity, and the potential lack of interoperability with existing technologies.&#xD;
•	Balance controlling technical diversity and IT-enabled business innovation.&#xD;
•	Prefer vendor-independent technologies to enable solution interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in.&#xD;
•	Reduce integration complexity by utilizing standardized integration approaches.&#xD;
•	Policies, standards, and procedures that govern acquisition of technology must be tied directly to this principle.&#xD;
•	Technology options will be constrained by the choices available within the supported standards. &#xD;
•	Technology options and preferred choices are published as “Technology Bricks” and governed through architecture governance. The “Bricks” are refreshed regularly to reflect appearance of new technologies and sunset of legacy technologies.&#xD;

      <documentation>6.3.	Quality Level Metrics (QLM) Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	QLM Approach&#xD;
Statement:	Technology implementations require quality level metrics (QLM) negotiations and tradeoff discussions to occur as early as possible in the architecture and design process between business stakeholders and systems stakeholders including application architects, technology architects, service providers and operations and maintenance staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Facilitates non-functional requirements gathering &#xD;
•	Avoids narrow discussions of requirements - business stakeholders will have a clearer idea of the system they are asking for / getting &#xD;
•	Better acceptance from the business on the system that is ultimately delivered – fewer surprises for both the business and I&amp;IT &#xD;
•	Better fit of applications into the infrastructure &#xD;
•	Better security&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Need to ensure that processes, such as product selections, vendor of record, planning, requirements gathering, have quality level metrics as part of the requirements. The standard QLMs are:&#xD;
    o	Scalability - The ability of the solution to scale up or down to meet the increase/ decrease in volume through increasing/decreasing the number of nodes/servers supporting the solution (horizontal scaling) or increasing/decreasing the resources of a single node/server  (vertical scaling)&#xD;
    o	Performance - The ability of the solution to meet the load and response time requires&#xD;
    o	Availability  - The ability of the solution to meet recovery time objectives, recovery point objectives and system up time&#xD;
    o	Recoverability - The ability of the solution to transaction recovery\rollback, guarantee atomicity, transactional checkpoint logging and backup&#xD;
    o	Integrity - The accuracy, completeness and timeliness of data at rest or in transit within a solution&#xD;
    o	Interoperability - The degree with which the system can connect to, exchange and process data from other systems.&#xD;
    o	Usability - The ability and extent the solution can be used by specific users to achieve specified goals effectively and efficiently&#xD;
    o	Source-ability - The degree to which equivalent solutions/services/components can be obtained from multiple sources&#xD;
    o	Affordability - The characteristics of a product or service that  provides the government value for money and falls within their budget  through the expected life span of the product or service&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Security-by-Design&#xD;
Statement:	Enable and protect activities and assets of both people and enterprises are built-in to any business practice and corresponding IT solution&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	ESDC’s  IM/IT assets are protected against theft, loss, damage, or unauthorized modification, destruction or disclosure to assure public confidence in the Department. &#xD;
•	When security protection for confidentiality, availability and integrity are considered up front., it is more cost effective and results are more robust and resilient.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Controls for the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability must be designed into all aspects of solutions from initiation, not as an afterthought.  &#xD;
•	Security must be designed in the business processes within which an IT system will be used.&#xD;
•	ESDC’s business solutions must be compliant with the Privacy Act; MITS; ATIP policies; FAA, etc.&#xD;
•	Security requirements must be determined with all stakeholders. &#xD;
•	Business driven security requirements based on legislation, policies, and business needs must be supported. &#xD;
•	A consistent, trusted and effective security model must be developed for use across all applications, data, systems, and infrastructure.&#xD;
•	Security Assessment and Audit (SA&amp;A) , and Statement of Sensitivity (SoS) processes shall be used to identify threats and risks and select cost effective controls which meet control objectives. &#xD;
•	A Vulnerability Assessment (VA) process shall be used to identifying and quantifying vulnerabilities in a system. &#xD;
•	Program managers need to have business impact analysis and business continuity planning processes developed and implemented. &#xD;
•	Program managers need to be part of the process to conduct the business impact analysis and to select contingency and business continuity plans. &#xD;
•	Business impact analysis should be coordinated with value/risk analysis to identify potential countermeasures to exposures to the ESDC during the design of new business processes. &#xD;
•	A controlled variance process must be adhered to.&#xD;
•	Accountable parties are responsible for establishing or aligning to authorised purposes for their assets &#xD;
•	Risk tolerances, breach mitigation and breach outcomes must be clearly defined beforehand.&#xD;
•	Ethically and legally, ESDC is obligated to protect Information / Data under its care to retain the right to manage and use it.&#xD;
•	Information / Data are sheltered from unauthorised access, modification, use, disclosure or destruction.&#xD;
•	Intellectual property and confidentiality is safeguarded.&#xD;
•	Sharing must be balanced against classification, proprietariness or sensitivity of Information / Data.&#xD;
•	Aggregation of Information / Data, such as for residual data must also be reviewed for sensitivity.&#xD;
•	Security must be applied at the appropriate level, i.e., data level versus application level.&#xD;
•	Systems and Information / Data must be safeguarded from malevolent intentions and disaster.&#xD;
•	Emerging technologies such as cloud and data lakes, must be accounted for in modernised policies,  standards and practices, and user awareness and training.&#xD;
•	Anonymization or masking techniques may be necessary and utilised before permitting certain access.&#xD;
•	Security controls must not hinder appropriate and timely access and sharing of assets s (e.g.  Information / data).&#xD;
&#xD;
GC Security Architecture &#xD;
•	Information categorization – As the originator of a record, each department is responsible for a plan, the implementation of information categorization systems and the review of data and information prior to release on the Open Government Portal (the “Portal”)&#xD;
•	Should it be third-party information (government to government, government to industry, other), additional release mechanisms are up to department review &#xD;
•	Training and awareness on the requirements of the Portal is needed (to reduce additional work for other departmental stakeholders such as ATIP officer or Privacy analysts)&#xD;
•	Departments are also responsible to review the metadata and telemetry of datasets, to reduce the risk that combining smaller pieces of the data can enable a malicious user to action one of the risk scenarios&#xD;
•	Legal and policy framework – Departments must continue to observe all domestic and international laws as they relate to handling resources, and should be respectful when considering which resources are being shared and released on the Portal&#xD;
•	Respect for privacy and persons – Departments must protect personal information by not releasing it on the Portal&#xD;
•	Departments must ensure that all data and information released on the Portal contains no personal information or is properly de-identified/anonymized&#xD;
•	Departments should be transparent about how data and information will be collected, used and shared on the Portal&#xD;
•	Within an “Open by Default” environment, departments must identify situations and datasets which cannot be released or be made open by design&#xD;
•	Forward planning – Departments should consider privacy and security when releasing records on the Portal.  Considerations should include:&#xD;
•	Consulting internally with business line and data / information owners / stewards to identify risks associated to the public, the organizations and the government as a whole&#xD;
•	Assessing privacy and security on an ongoing basis, as due diligence does not end with uploading a record but rather an ongoing responsibility to maintain the accuracy and completeness of all records&#xD;
•	Making plans prior to the release of records for their maintenance and periodic reviews of the privacy and security implications of the universe of relevant records available on the Portal&#xD;
•	Assigning clear accountabilities within departments and agencies for considering privacy and security implications of open government records&#xD;
•	Security and Privacy Incidents and Remediation – Departments and agencies will take steps to ensure their ability to respond effectively in the case of a privacy or security incident&#xD;
•	In the event of any real or suspected security incidents, departments and agencies will respond in accordance with the Directive on Departmental Security Management (DDSM), departmental and agency processes and procedures, and when applicable the Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP)  &#xD;
•	In the event of any real or suspected privacy breach, departments and agencies will respond in accordance with the Directive on Privacy Practices. Departments and agencies should apprise themselves of TBS Guidelines for Privacy Breaches and the Privacy Breach Management Toolkit. These privacy instruments identify causes of privacy breaches, provide guidance on how to respond, contain and manage privacy breaches, delineate roles and responsibilities, and include links to relevant supporting documentation&#xD;
•	Considerations for maximizing release – When considering de-identifying information and data, the following should be noted:&#xD;
•	De-identification needs to be done by trained officials&#xD;
•	Software for de-identification is not always available and may need to be developed&#xD;
•	Effective de-identification may reduce the granularity of records and, as a result, data and information quality may decrease&#xD;
•	De-identification can be costly and require significant investments of resources, time, and data processing&#xD;
•	Extrapolation or aggregation risks may persist in spite of de-identification efforts&#xD;

      <documentation>7.3.	Integrity-by-Design&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Integrity-by-Design&#xD;
Statement:	Provide clients with a high degree of trust that the system and its attendant data and information are correct (i.e., precise, accurate and meaningful), valid (created, modified and deleted only by authorized users) and invariant (i.e., consistent an unmodified).&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Integrity is one of the three central pillars of securing corporate information assets along with confidentiality and availability. Integrity keeps data pure and trustworthy by protecting system and data from intentional or accidental changes. &#xD;
•	With data being the primary information asset, integrity provides the assurance that the data is accurate and reliable. Without integrity, the cost of collecting and maintaining the data cannot be justified. Therefore, policies and procedures should support ensuring that data can be trusted.&#xD;
•	Mechanisms put in place to ensure the integrity of the system, its data and information should prevent attacks on the storage of that data (contamination) and on its transmission (interference). Data that is altered on the network between the storage and the user's workstation can be as untrustworthy as the attacker altering or deleting the data on the storage media. Protecting data involves both storage and network mechanisms.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Unauthorized users must be prevented from making modifications to data or programs.&#xD;
•	Unauthorized users must be prevented from making improper or unauthorized modifications.&#xD;
•	Internal and external consistency of data and programs must be maintained.&#xD;
•	Applying encryption to information that will be sent over the Internet or stored on digital media.&#xD;
•	Software must be built defensively.&#xD;
•	Users should be prevented from inadvertently storing inaccurate or invalid data by incorrect data entry, an incorrect decision made in running programs, or not following procedures.&#xD;
•	Users should be prevented from affecting integrity through system configuration errors at their workstations or even by using the wrong programs to access the data.&#xD;
•	Users should be taught about devicde and data integrity during their information security awareness training.&#xD;
•	The installation of any new software or devices must be prevented except when done by a limited set of authorized people. &#xD;
•	Check system integrity against a set of predefined validation policies or standards.&#xD;

      <documentation>1.2.	What are Principles?&#xD;
Architecture principles are a set of statements that inform architecture decisions (e.g. “Doing the Right Thing”) and work (e.g. “Doing EA  Right”). &#xD;
&#xD;
Bizbok and  TOGAF,  define principles as:&#xD;
•	An agreed upon truth that can guide one’s reasoning. (Bizbok 7.5 glossary)&#xD;
•	EA principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission (TOGAF 9.2 Chapter 20.1).&#xD;
To that end the essence of ESDC EA Principles are:&#xD;
•	EA Assement Principles: “Doing the Right Thing” inform architecture decisions to ensure  the department is doing the right thing to acheive its strategic goals and act on its mandate.  &#xD;
•	EA Program Principles: “Doing EA Right”,  inform architure work to ensure architectures are being developed and implemented the correct way.  (e.g TOGAF EA Principles, GC Architectural Standards)&#xD;
&#xD;
In general, the EA Principles are high-level statements of the fundamental values that guide business and IM/IT decision-making. EA Principles the foundation for architectures, policies, standards and processes. Because the EA Principles define a value system, once they are defined and agreed upon, they are not likely to change frequently; however they will be reviewed on an annual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
To be effective, EA Principles must be considered as a set, not individually. It is common to have sets of principles form a hierarchy in those more detailed principles are informed by and elaborate on the principles at a higher level.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Enterprise Architecture Principles are comprised of:&#xD;
    o	Domain Architecture Principles (Business, Information and Data, Application, Technology, Security &amp; Privacy) &#xD;
    o	Reference Architecture Principles&#xD;
    o	Security Architecture Principles&#xD;
    o	Solution Architecture Principles&#xD;
        	Design Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
ESDC Enterprise Architecture Principles are informed and constrained by the Government of Canada and the ESDC Service Strategy principles. Employment and Social Development Canada’s Service Strategy Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
1.5.	Value of EA Principles&#xD;
The EA Principles are intended to simplify, not complicate business decisions. They are most valuable in evaluating complex situations with multiple competing goals and where no clear rules or directives have been established. Conformance to the EA Principles as outlined in this document will:&#xD;
•	Optimize business value and departmental benefits realization;&#xD;
•	Provide a framework for assessing and prioritizing changes;&#xD;
•	Allow for change to be accommodated in a less disruptive manner;&#xD;
•	Facilitate the fulfilment of the business requirements;&#xD;
•	Lower the overall life cycle cost of applications;&#xD;
•	Improve the manageability of the architectural components;&#xD;
•	Support an active vs. reactive approach to planning service delivery projects.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="1. New Target Operating Model and service continuity during the transition" id="id-8e50bfcb838d40a8bffb573f51acc409">
      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 1: &#xD;
Principle:	New Target Operating Model and service continuity during the transition &#xD;
Statement:	BDM will implement a new Target Operating Model designed for the future. Transition will be gradual and iterative ensuring service continuity.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM service modernization and service ambitions cannot be realized with technology modernization only – a new Operating Model is required. BDM will modernize services that deliver over $122B annually to Canadians, many of which are mission critical as they support most vulnerable clients in the time of need. Disruption to the delivery of these services is unacceptable.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Architectures and solutions proposed as strategic and target state will be evaluated against the new Target Operating Model.&#xD;
•	To ensure service continuity, co-existence model where new solutions and legacy operate in parallel will be required. &#xD;
•	Co-existence model inherently leads to a greater complexity than the current or target state. Among different viable architectures that are fit to support the new Target Operating Model and co-existence, less complex ones will be favoured over more complex options.&#xD;
•	Evaluation of  architectures and proposed solutions in regards to their ability to integrate and operate in a co-existence model will be presented to BDM-ARC.</documentation>

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 2: &#xD;
Principle:	BDM will consume GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services where appropriate and available.&#xD;
Statement:	BDM will consume a GC or ESDC enterprise solution/service where it exists and meets all BDM mandatory and majority of non-mandatory functional and non-functional requirements, as well as, when there is a commitment and plan for long-term investment in sustainment and support.&#xD;
Rationale: 	With each decision to leverage an existing solution or service, BDM will inherit risks associated with the architecture, deployment, availability and operations of the solution/service. Solutions and services which may have not been designed for the scale required by BDM or lack appropriate investment commitments, product roadmaps and operational and support models, present a risk to the BDM Programme. &#xD;
Implications:	•	GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services will be evaluated against BDM requirements. If gaps are identified, it is expected that an investment and a project plan are put in place to close the gaps. &#xD;
•	The architecture of the GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services will be evaluated for alignment and compatibility with the BDM solution architecture. &#xD;
•	BDM may present opportunities to enhance or modernize certain enterprise solutions and services. Such opportunities will be identified as architecture options and presented to BDM-ARC.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 3:&#xD;
Principle:	Favour strategic over interim and tactical solutions.&#xD;
Statement:	BDM will favour investment in strategic solutions and technologies over investment in interim and tactical ones. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Strategic solutions and technologies are those that are selected and deployed with a plan to support service delivery over a long term (10+ years). Tactical and interim solutions are both expected to be replaced by Strategic solutions, either in a relatively short time period (tactical) or over longer term (interim). &#xD;
Implications:	•	Investments in interim and tactical solutions, unless required for legislative, significant business value/savings or service continuity reasons, will be presented as architecture options with generally lower score for EA alignment than strategic solutions.&#xD;
•	BDM will support investments in interim and tactical solutions that are expected to deliver immediate business outcomes when they do not constitute an obstacle to the BDM implementation or significantly increase BDM technical debt. We advise to establish and monitor metrics for identified business outcomes throughout the lifecycle of the investment.&#xD;
•	Architecture of the interim or tactical solution may be reviewed if the solution needs to integrate with the BDM solution or support BDM implementation, for instance, by generating data and insights that would inform BDM service design and/or architecture.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="6. Open Solutions and standards" id="id-79797bbebaa04266b828a722e79c4390">
      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 6: &#xD;
Principle:	Open Solutions and standards. &#xD;
Statement:	Open solutions by default, proprietary by exception. SaaS and COTS that support open standards are considered open solutions. Open source will be considered where appropriate. &#xD;
Rationale: 	In an ideal scenario, solutions (or their components) are interoperable and substitutable: each one can be substituted easily and independently. This can be achieved only when solutions support open standards. &#xD;
Implications:	•	Open standards and industry best practices are and will continue to be embedded in BDM architecture and functional and non-functional requirements.&#xD;
•	Proprietary solutions that do not support open standards or are not substitutable for any reason must be identified and granted an exception by BDM-ARC and EARB. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Note on open standards and open source software (Reference: Open Standards Whitepaper on GitHub):&#xD;
The following criteria define open standards:&#xD;
process for the standard's development is open and transparent to all interested parties and cannot be controlled by any single person or entity with any vested interests;&#xD;
platform independent, vendor neutral and usable for multiple implementations;&#xD;
specifications and supporting material are freely available with limited restrictions;&#xD;
supported by the community and demonstrate independence or approved through due process by rough consensus among participants.&#xD;
Open source software (OSS) is a way of developing and distributing software. The code is often written collaboratively, and it can be downloaded, used and changed by anyone.&#xD;
Open source software (OSS) and open standards are separate concepts, however there are strong ties between them. OSS tends to use and help define open standards and publicly available specifications. OSS are, by their nature, publicly available specifications, and the availability of their source code promotes open, democratic debate around their specifications, making them both more robust and interoperable. </documentation>

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 7: &#xD;
Principle:	Security and Privacy-by-Design. &#xD;
Statement:	Balance Service and Security. &#xD;
Balance Service and proactive and personalized Service Experience and Privacy.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Security measure can present constraints for data collection and client interaction. Similarly, proactive and personalized service requires collecting and analyzing client data and proactively initiating interactions with the client which can be viewed as at odds with respecting client’s privacy. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will seek to balance client and business needs with appropriate security measures. &#xD;
•	Evaluation of architectures and proposed solutions in regards to applicable and supported security measures will be presented to BDM-ARC.&#xD;
•	BDM will seek to reduce constraints related to data collection and data access and sharing, while maintaining a focus on privacy (e.g. leveraging a client consent-based model). &#xD;

&#xD;
Principle:	Integrity &amp; Quality-by-Design. &#xD;
Statement:	BDM will embed integrity and quality controls up-front and throughout processes and services. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Embedded approach to integrity and quality management is required to move away from “pay-and-chase” model and enable continuous service improvement. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will ease burden of proof on clients, based on risk and complexity profile, while maintaining compliance and integrity checks.  &#xD;
•	Client risk, priority and complexity profile will result from integrity and quality controls embedded in processes and services.&#xD;
•	Quality and continuous improvement will be embedded in all processes.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 9: &#xD;
Principle:	Cloud First. &#xD;
Statement:	Cloud First. BDM will leverage cloud where appropriate and available.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Cloud computing means providing infrastructure services and application services on demand. This is made possible through a high level of virtualization of hardware components by way of infrastructure service software. The result is highly scalable, elastic, available and programmable infrastructure. All these characteristics are of great importance to BDM. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will leverage cloud where applicable, available and where it meets BDM security requirements. &#xD;
•	All cloud deployment options (including SaaS) will be explored and evaluated as part of the solution design.&#xD;
•	BDM will ensure that requirements for performance, availability, and scalability (including peak traffic periods) are met by all BDM solutions and components (new and legacy) and the hosting infrastructure. &#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 4: &#xD;
Principle: 	Data is at the center of BDM.&#xD;
Statement:	Data is at the center of BDM. BDM embraces Data Management-by-design by building services and processes that support and enable appropriate data access, standards and quality for ESDC clients, partners and staff. BDM advocates leveraging data from an authoritative source.  &#xD;
Rationale: 	Data has a great potential to support and inform better decisions both in service design and continuous improvement and in adjudicating and processing client applications and requests. To realize such potential, data needs to be relevant, reliable and available.  &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will strive to enable data driven approach to decision making in service design and continuous improvement .&#xD;
•	BDM will enable data-as-a-service approach by enabling access to authoritative sources of data whenever possible. &#xD;
•	Data gathered once.&#xD;
•	Collecting the same data from the client multiple times for the use in different programs will be avoided.&#xD;
•	Transferring and replicating data will be done judiciously and only when necessary for functional or performance reasons.  &#xD;

Principle:	Digital First. &#xD;
Statement:	Digital First. BDM will design and implement digital interfaces to enable and encourage submission of information in a digital format through the digital channel and third-party systems and end-user applications.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM target state characteristics include digitally enabled services and responsive, proactive and inclusive service experience. BDM goals, among others, include:&#xD;
•	empowering clients to self-serve by providing an attractive, seamless and end-to-end service delivery option through the digital channel;&#xD;
•	leveraging the support of NGOs, public and private sector partners to optimize and deliver a better, more impactful client outcomes.&#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will design and implement new digital channel solutions that will enable seamless and accessible client self-service.&#xD;
•	Functionality will be exposed as services via APIs where applicable and of business value.&#xD;
•	BDM will encourage and work with service delivery partners to change their existing systems or develop new end-user applications for their staff and clients to submit data to ESDC in a digital format.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 10: &#xD;
Principle:	Minimize changes to legacy. &#xD;
Statement:	Minimize changes and write-back to legacy. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Co-existence model inherently leads to significant complexity. BDM needs to design deployment strategy, transition architecture, services, processes and integration between new solutions and legacy to control complexity and risk. One of the approaches to control complexity is to minimize changes to legacy.&#xD;
Implications:	Architecture objectives and planning assumptions (to be validated through prototyping):&#xD;
•	There will be one system of record for each transaction.&#xD;
•	Transactions will be process either in the new or legacy system, not in both.&#xD;
•	Data will be accessed in the other system as needed.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 11: &#xD;
Principle:	Architecting for Agility&#xD;
Statement:	BDM solutions will be architected for agility, creating modular and flexible architecture and reducing risks of vendor lock-in. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Architecting for agility is a fundamental shift in delivering IT services, moving away from operational inefficiencies to flexible, decoupled solutions. It will position ESDC to adapt to technology changes and ever-changing client and business needs and expectations.&#xD;
Our objective is to create a flexible and resilient BDM architecture that enables agility to continuously innovate. An architecture that has greater agility will enable ESDC to have a more fluid and flexible technology landscape, setting us up to be more responsive and adaptable to future changes.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Platforms and products that consist of individually deployable modules will be preferred over monolithic solutions.&#xD;
•	Solutions and modules will be decoupled whenever possible without causing performance or latency issues.&#xD;
•	Architecture decisions will be made just in time to enable procurement and implementation. Making them too early may create undesirable constraints on the scope and technology options.&#xD;
•	BDM will consider alternatives and keep them &quot;open&quot; as long as they remain viable. It should be recognized that not all technical decisions can be made at the same time: there is benefit to making some decisions later when they can be better informed by business decisions and through additional analysis and prototyping. &#xD;
•	BDM will be prepared to refactor (change) architecture. Architecture work products will evolve and be further developed throughout the BDM Programme lifecycle. We will iterate and improve architecture periodically and as needed.&#xD;
•	BDM will identify and analyze architectural dependencies and incorporate them into a responsive model: we will strive to integrate dependencies through loose coupling and have contingency plan when they are yet to be implemented.&#xD;
•	Caveat: This principle will compete with Principle #3: Favour strategic over interim and tactical solutions. Tactical solutions may be necessary to help us achieve desired level of agility.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="12. Maximize Use of Core Technology" id="id-549c7d1e7a5541369f53e0915c10e549">
      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 12: &#xD;
Principle:	Maximize Use of Core Technology&#xD;
Statement:	Consider leveraging capabilities and functionality of the Core Technology (Cùram Social Program Management) before considering other solutions and applications for common benefit processing and service delivery.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Leveraging investment in the platform and making use of OOTB business logic and processes will greatly improve ESDC agility and ability to implement new benefits and implement changes to existing benefits and processes.&#xD;
Additionally, this will reduce complexity of implementation and cost of ownership minimizing the need for integration with other dependant applications. &#xD;
Implications:	•	Business may have to accept that not all requirements will be fully met by the Core Technology solution. &#xD;
•	Design of some future state business processes may need to be adjusted to leverage OOTB business logic and processes.&#xD;
•	Evolving business needs may require moving away from specific capabilities of the Core Technology solution in the future. This situation would trigger changes in architecture, transition to either specialized best of breed or enterprise solutions and possibly procurement. Principle #11: Architecting for Agility mitigates this implication.&#xD;
•	Core Technology solution architecture becomes the architecture for the Common Benefit Delivery Platform.  &#xD;
•	Enables alignment of the BDM solution evolution and improvements with the Cùram Social Program Management product roadmap and plans for future improvements.&#xD;
•	Supports an MVP approach.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 13: &#xD;
Principle:	Adoption of Event-Driven Architecture&#xD;
Statement:	Preference will be given to event-driven architecture to help build decoupled, responsive, adaptive and resilient solutions.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Modernization of digital channels and services, as well as planned advances in service delivery and common benefit processing, require ability to access data and process events and transactions in (near) real time. Solutions and services need to be designed to “react to events” and process them in (near) real time where desirable and to the extent possible.&#xD;
This type of architecture adds a layer that further decouples architecture components, making the overall architecture more adaptive and resilient.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Key objective is to move from batch to predominantly (near) real-time services and transactions.&#xD;
•	Every integration should be considered for event driven approach. BDM will implement the most appropriate pattern for each integration with a view to move to event-driven integrations whenever this approach is aligned with the business processes the integration enables. &#xD;
•	We will assess supporting solutions and dependencies for their ability of being event driven and can participate without added complexity.&#xD;
•	Best practices and lessons learned from previous successful implementations of these technologies will be consulted prior to making the decision.&#xD;
•	We do not recommend “Everything is an Event” approach. Complementary integration patterns exist and will be considered for integrations that are not natively event-driven. Data integration technologies are available too!&#xD;
•	Selection and implementation of an Event Broker and Messaging Platform becomes high priority for Tranche 1.&#xD;
•	Caveat: Cùram SPM includes OOTB batch processes that need to be implemented as defined by the platform. No previous implementations of Cùram were based on event driven architecture.&#xD;
•	Caveat: This type of architecture requires highly-available and resilient network and infrastructure. Cost may increase.&#xD;
•	Caveat: Will require high transaction rate through SCED which raises performance and bandwidth concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;

Principle:	Outcome-driven (proposed by business architecture)&#xD;
Statement:	Architectural decisions will seek to maximize value to clients, partners, staff, ESDC, and the GoC driven by the overall Programme strategy.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM will seek to realize benefits for clients, partners, staff, ESDC, and the GoC.  Decisions regarding the architecture of BDM should be primarily focused on delivering on the outcomes outlined in the strategy.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Decisions regarding the technical and solution architecture should be weighed against their ability to achieve strategic outcomes and impact on the targeted stakeholders&#xD;

      <documentation>Connecting to Benefits Delivery Modernization Milestones&#xD;
Benefits Delivery Modernization (BDM) is a large-scale transformation of the Employment Insurance (EI), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Old Age Security (OAS) programs and services, designed to deliver an improved client service delivery experience. Did you know that one of Enterprise Architecture’s main priorities for the next three years is the alignment and realization of the BDM programme? As Enterprise Architecture (EA) practitioners, we will be able to claim success when architectural investments:&#xD;
• contribute to or accelerate the realization of the target state of BDM outcomes; and&#xD;
• align to the BDM target state.&#xD;
It can be daunting for an architect to have more questions than answers on the meaning of “BDM alignment and realization.” To help you wrap your head around this, here’s a look at how EA connects to BDM milestones:</documentation>

Another possible approach is the adoption of the 80/20 rule, where 80 percent of value is achieved with 20 percent of the total allocated time.

      <documentation>Principle 3 - Expect Uncertainty, and Manage for It Through Iterations, Anticipation and Adaptation&#xD;
People like linearity: They generally like knowing what is expected of them atwork, and they like mastery of the work they do. They also like not having to think all the time because thinking is exhausting work. This has led to a trend in technology based on the belief that projects can be delivered consistently. To combat these people challenges, because change initiatives are inherently complex and uncertain, change initiatives in a business-Agile mindset need to be:&#xD;
• iterative: helps to ease the cognitive load that uncertainty entails. An iteration is defined as a unit of valuable work;&#xD;
• anticipable: based on intuition and “gut feeling,” a project team has theability to identify early warning signs that the iteration/project will not deliver value, and course-correct; and&#xD;
• adaptive: relates to doing something different based on a change in circumstances. An organization with a business-Agile mindset takes advantage of a change in circumstances to do things better, more quickly or with potentially greater business value and better business outcomes.</documentation>

      <documentation>Principle 4 - Unleash Creativity and Innovation by Recognizing That Individuals Are the Ultimate Source of Value, and Create an Environment Where They Can Make a Difference&#xD;
The essence of this principle is to, at all times, commit to the concept of “doing with” rather than “doing to.” A relentless focus on the “source of the problem” keeps organizations locked in “us versus them” thinking, and through blame trivializes the contribution of the people who currently work in the organization.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="Make Efforts To Understand the Data" id="id-4c73716bf7ee489186426704a2ebdd10">
      <documentation>Understanding the Data&#xD;
The first challenge of data integration is to understand the data. This is a problem at two levels.&#xD;
At a higher level, there is the need to understand the business context and the value of the data: to know which parts of it are important, and which combinations of it can contribute to business deliverables.&#xD;
At the most basic level, the problem is a lack of data models and documentation. The data is often described only by cryptic entity, attribute, and domain field names that meant something to the business subject matter expert, programmer, or database administrator who hurriedly created them to satisfy system constraints or a production deadline, but are incomprehensible to those conducting the data integration or data migration effort.&#xD;
As discussed in An Information Architecture Vision: Moving from Data Rich to Information Smart (see References), possibly 10% of data holdings are documented, and the cryptic definition of entities, attributes, and domain values is often incomprehensible. In addition, without overarching data models there tends to be major redundancy, leading to poor data quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are four main issues that are encountered:&#xD;
• Enterprise-structured data holdings are embedded within individual applications using incoherent tables in separate database files&#xD;
• In some legacy systems, data may be embedded in the system code or retained using flat or indexed file paradigms that are inaccessible by current standard structured query languages&#xD;
• When Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) applications or cloud services are used, often the data structures are not provided and there is only limited data download access&#xD;
• There is often no or limited metadata&#xD;
&#xD;
Metadata provides a context for the data, addressing items such as who created the data and when, the security classification, the data quality, and so on. Metadata is key to effective data integration, especially when redundant data must be consolidated, and new metadata generated.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="Manage Complexity In Mapping Between Different Data Models" id="id-ba35720ac4e14c9482296b55b35aada9">
      <documentation>Mapping Between Different Data Models&#xD;
&#xD;
Typically, independently created data sources are based on different data models. This reflects the fact that they have different scopes, though often with some common elements, and represent different views of the world. For the sources to be integrated, there must be mappings between their data models and a third, common data model.&#xD;
When the number of sources to be integrated is large, the problem of mapping them is extremely complex and difficult. There are, however, technologies that can help the data engineer to perform this task.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="Keep Data Synchronized" id="id-634781f413e4495595dc54a9883cf5ae">
      <documentation>Synchronizing Data&#xD;
Often, different systems, or different applications on the same system, use the same data and maintain their own copies. These may be exact copies, or they may include only part of the data, or the data they include may be transformed from the original.&#xD;
For example, a company may maintain core data as a “single source of truth” and different divisions and departments may transform it in different business-specific ways so that it has relevance and purpose for them.&#xD;
Keeping these versions synchronized as the data changes can be a major challenge.</documentation>

      <documentation>Organizational and Cultural Issues&#xD;
Even with the support of technology, data integration requires skill, and its results may impact different parts of the enterprise. Ensuring that the right people are in place, with the right training, and that the affected departments are prepared for the change, is a major challenge.&#xD;
There may well be a need to review the enterprise’s data governance regimen. For major data integration projects in areas fundamental to the enterprise, there may be a need to review its culture, especially executive willingness to maintain and share data.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Quality&#xD;
Poor quality data will sabotage any data integration effort and subsequently harm the business. This is an issue for data integration projects that combine data from sources of variable quality. The quality of the result is crucial to its success. This means keeping track of the lineage of the integrated data, and always paying attention to its quality.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Defense&#xD;
Maintaining data quality is just one of the aspects of good data defense – minimizing the risks to a company that arise from its data. This also includes ensuring compliance with regulations, using analytics to detect and limit fraud, and building systems to ensure the security and integrity of the data. Data integration systems must be robust and secure, and contribute to the overall defense of the data.&#xD;
Legislative compliance is a particular issue. Integrated data may contravene privacy or other legislation. Consequently, it may need to be further processed (e.g., anonymized) before it can be used, or perhaps even restructured to accommodate potentially costly legal requirements such as data subject access requests.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="View Data Integration As A Continuous Process" id="id-e77ef9c535f84fb0b21b336e0c39bab3">
      <documentation>Data Fabric&#xD;
A data fabric enables frictionless access and sharing of data in a distributed data environment. It enables a single and consistent data management framework, which allows seamless data access and processing by design across otherwise siloed storage. It may use analytics to constantly monitor data pipelines and support the design, deployment, and utilization of diverse data. Gartner® Data and Analysis Trends, 2021 (see References) claim that this can reduce time for integration by 30%, deployment by 30%, and maintenance by 70%.&#xD;
A data fabric has an application interface, and often also a user interface. It gives the ability to write data, as well as to read it. The sources may be on-premise or in the cloud. Data fabrics deliver a unified, intelligent, and integrated end-to-end platform to support data use-cases. They provide the ability to deliver use-cases quickly by leveraging innovation in dynamic integration, distributed, and multi-cloud architectures, graph engines, and distributed in-memory and persistent memory platforms. Data fabric focuses on automating the process integration, transformation, preparation, curation, security, governance, and orchestration to enable analytics and insights quickly for business success. It minimizes complexity by automating processes, workflows, and pipelines, generating code, and streamlining data to accelerate various use-cases.&#xD;
An application can read data from or update data in multiple sources, describing the data in terms of a common data model. The read and update requests are converted by data platforms to requests that describe the data in terms of the source data models. The data is then obtained from the sources and integrated, or updated in the sources, by continual synchronization or dynamic query.</documentation>

      <documentation>Advantages of a Zero Trust-Driven Future&#xD;
Zero Trust enables mobility and user choice because people can work anywhere on any (secure) device they choose, using the applications and data they need. This leads to improved organizational productivity, agility, and the ability to proactively support new and evolving capabilities.&#xD;
Zero Trust improves confidence in the security mechanisms used to protect data and applications, further enabling the business.&#xD;
Zero Trust provides support for quickly evolving organizational ecosystems, by enabling rapid creation and dissolution of business-to-business relationships.&#xD;
As Figure 5 shows, in this digitized world, remote work is part of the norm. The digitization of organizations introduces complexity and the need for agility driven by, for example:&#xD;
• Migration to the cloud&#xD;
• The need to leverage SaaS providers&#xD;
• Continued leveraging of legacy assets</documentation>

The remaining sections of this document identify and briefly describe the relevant standards and discuss some wider considerations. They are:&#xD;
• Representation Standards – dealing with how information is represented as data at a fundamental level in data sets and APIs&#xD;
These standards can apply to source data, integrated data, and contextual metadata.&#xD;
• Structure Standards – dealing with how data is structured in data sets and APIs&#xD;
These standards also can apply to source data, integrated data, and contextual metadata.&#xD;
• API Standards – dealing with additional considerations where data is obtained from or posted to APIs, rather than being read from or written to data sets&#xD;
• Metadata Standards – applying mainly to contextual metadata but in some cases also to metadata included in source data or integrated data&#xD;
• Data Analysis and Transformation Standards – applying to software components that perform analysis or transformation&#xD;
• Wider Considerations for Data Integration Standards – discussing some existing standards and best practices that might be relevant, and new standards work that might be useful in relation to non-technical aspects of data integration</documentation>

      <documentation>In Budget 2018, $110 million was earmarked over six years to support SSC’s Workload Migration program, with the objective to modernize and enhance the government’s digital services. These funds are to be accessed by SSC’s partner departments to help them to modernize and to migrate their applications from older data centres to cloud solutions or to more modern data centres.&#xD;
Through the Benefits Delivery Modernization (BDM) program and the Technical Debt Remediation (TDR) initiatives, ESDC will be addressing many of the legacy systems and applications currently residing in legacy data centre. However, it will not address all of it; some applications will remain in the legacy data centres and will continue to present risks related to infrastructure, architecture as well as technology used. The WLM program plans on dealing with these remaining applications.&#xD;
The preliminary assessment shows that out of 333 applications in the Montréal and Moncton Data Centres, 22 require immediate attention due to aging IT, and 162 require a high level of attention in the coming years. The application life cycle indicates that 272 of them will need to be replatformed/replaced/rebuilt/revised/retired in a near future in order to adapt to the ongoing and growing demands in IT.&#xD;

      <documentation>Design with users&#xD;
Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Design with users&#xD;
Services should not be built based on internal constraints or complexities of government, they should be built to address the needs of users. In order to deliver value to users, one must understand and prioritize their needs. Everything is a hypothesis until tested with the users of services.&#xD;
&#xD;
To validate one's hypotheses, one must validate their assumptions through direct and frequent interactions with those who will be using the services. Users may be members of the public, or government employees or a combination thereof. Keeping in mind that users will come from diverse backgrounds, varying in location, experience, knowledge, and abilities, requirements for services are built first and foremost with the needs of all users. When designing services, one must take a holistic approach to service delivery -- from each member's individual contributions to the end goal, as defined by user requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. End-user feedback is used to establish the requirements of our service(s).&#xD;
2. Our team has processes or tools in place for user feedback, including anonymous user feedback, to be incorporated into the design of the service.&#xD;
3. Our team conducts user research prior to deciding upon a given implementation. &#xD;
4. Our team has tested our primary systems in the users’ context with a wide range of users including users with varying needs and representing diverse backgrounds.&#xD;
5. Our team considers user needs and feedback in defining key service metrics.&#xD;
6. Our team uses automation to anticipate and detect operational or quality-of-service issues before our users tell us.&#xD;
7. Our team has within it, or direct access to, the expertise required to conduct user research and usability testing.&#xD;

      <documentation>Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
In contrast to high risk and long lead time ‘big bang’ deployments, working services must be put in the hands of users as early as possible to get rapid feedback. Said feedback is then used to iterate upon to improve the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
One sets a north star to define a clear direction, then begins iterating towards this north star, keeping in mind that the path is not clear, and unexpected circumstances will require adjustments to be made along the way. By leveraging modern technologies and modern approaches to working, risk can be reduced by limiting the size of changes and increasing their frequency. Processes should empower teams to deliver value to services as often as possible, rather than increase risk by creating prolonged processes that use documentation in place of demonstrably functioning software. Focus on working software over comprehensive documentation and remember that perfect is the enemy of good.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. There are processes in place to prioritize and implement feedback from peers, stakeholders and end-users.&#xD;
2. When a new or updated service or feature is being created our team understands the minimum requirements for the system to be of value to users.&#xD;
3. Our team experiments with new approaches based on team reflections, lessons learned, and user feedback.&#xD;

3. Our team identifies solutions before it is clear what outcomes our team is working towards and how to measure them.&#xD;
4. Processes are rarely, if ever, reviewed to find and implement efficiencies.&#xD;
5. Our team must wait for the project to be approved and funded prior to environments being made available to teams to begin experimenting with solutions.&#xD;
6. Our team fully architects the end to the service delivery solution prior to starting to build.</documentation>

      <documentation>Work in the open by default&#xD;
Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Work in the open by default&#xD;
Working in the open increases the transparency of services, increases trust in government, creates an ecosystem that promotes innovation, prevents needing to reinvent the wheel by increasing collaboration within, and external to, government. Working in the open promotes understanding of government processes and services and creates an environment whereby innovation can take place throughout the Government of Canada and through non-governmental organizations leveraging the government data and information to improve service delivery for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
This way of working aligns Canada with the Digital Nations Charter, of which it is a signatory and promotes “transparency and citizen participation and uses open licences to produce and consume open data”, and the Open Data Charter. Further, by working in the open the Government of Canada can increase its reuse of existing public solutions and allow others to reuse work conducted by the Government of Canada. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Teams continually makes all non-sensitive and non-personal data, information, and new code publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, for sharing and reuse.&#xD;
2. Our team contributes back to the public projects from which they borrow content.&#xD;
3. Our team tracks and makes public the metrics upon which our team measures its success.&#xD;
4. Our team tracks, and makes publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, information regarding how often a change to our services fails (e.g., the deployment or rollout of a service or feature experiences issues or complications).&#xD;

2. The work of our team has permissions set so that only members of our team can access the team's work.&#xD;
3. Our team does not contribute to, or collaborate on, work being done by our colleagues.&#xD;
4. Team applies blanket security classification for the digital system to all data stored by the application.&#xD;
5. Our team has no process by which to declassify and release records when they are no longer protected or classified.&#xD;

Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices, including the use of open source software where appropriate. Design for services and platforms that are seamless for Canadians to use no matter what device or channel they are using.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Use open standards and solutions&#xD;
To maintain the trust of Canadians, the government must continually learn and improve by embracing leading practices to simplify access to government services to match the rising expectations of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
In alignment with the Digital Nations Charter, which calls for both the use of Open Standards and Open Source, this Digital Standard aligns with the ultimate Digital Vision which reads, “The Government of Canada is an open and service-oriented organization that operates and delivers programs and services to people and businesses in simple, modern and effective ways that are optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere and from any device.” By leveraging open source software, and leveraging open standards and solutions, the Government of Canada can mitigate vendor lock-in and expand its vendor pool from which to acquire digital services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team prioritizes solutions using open standards over solutions that do not.&#xD;
2. Team members give back to the open source community as active contributors.&#xD;
3. Our team designs their services to be interoperable with other services.&#xD;

      <documentation>Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. Make security measures frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Digital services are core to service delivery, and they must securely store and manage the information of Canadians to maintain trust in government services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Security and privacy should be taken as a consideration from the onset of work for a given service, in alignment with Iterate and Improve. The implementation of security and privacy controls should be considered part of daily work. Similarly, processes should promote and monitor the continuous implementation of security and privacy controls throughout the lifecycle of a service. This will demonstrably increase the security and privacy posture of digital services by leveraging automated testing and real time reporting and monitoring over anecdotal document-heavy manual processes. Said processes, and the security and privacy controls themselves, should be frictionless, ensuring that services are designed first and foremost for users, not to satisfy existing legacy government procedures, tooling, or processes. Furthermore, by creating frictionless processes and permitting services to be iterated and improved upon quickly, the government is better situated to respond quickly to security or privacy risk. By responding to these operational needs within hours or minutes rather than months, the government can improve its security and privacy posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team considers security and privacy throughout the service design process.&#xD;
2. When implementing or enforcing security or privacy controls, our team takes into consideration how they would impact the quality or efficiency of the service and how it will impact the end users of the service.&#xD;
3. Security measures are frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
4. Our team has privacy and security knowledge and understanding as a competency within the team.&#xD;
5. The service has implemented automated security checks and privacy protections include role-based access and audit functions against the service.&#xD;
6. There are procedures and processes in place to quickly respond to security or privacy breaches or incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Team has no internal privacy or security knowledge, relying on other teams to identify nearly all security or privacy controls and best practices.&#xD;
2. The core services upon which our team works have no automated security checks or privacy protections.&#xD;
3. Our team relies on security through obscurity, hiding services or information rather than improving the security posture of the service.&#xD;
4. Our team implements or enforces security or privacy controls without considering the impact on service usability.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Build In Accessibility From the Start (Principle) (copy)" id="id-ea9d2e3003134f748d9cba2467a8fbd4">
      <documentation>Build in accessibility from the start&#xD;
Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Build in accessibility from the start&#xD;
Quality should be built in from the start, preventing the need to revisit previously implemented components due to issues, such as accessibility. The faster and earlier issues are found the less costly they are to fix.&#xD;
&#xD;
Accessibility in Canada is about creating communities, workplaces and services that enable everyone to participate fully in society without barriers. The Government of Canada is committed to taking a proactive and systemic approach for identifying, removing and preventing barriers to accessibility without delay complementing the rights of persons with disabilities under the Canadian Human Rights Act. To meet these commitments, accessibility should be a consideration throughout the service development lifecycle. This requires that accessibility be monitored and built into our processes to continually promote alignment with accessibility standards. While iterating and improving frequently and designing with users, accessibility should be a key consideration, and become a source of work items throughout the service design lifecycle. When designing with users, efforts should be made to identify a wide variety of users with a wide variety of needs, to ensure accessibility standards are met or exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Starting at the outset, our team's service and platform design continually considers the lowest levels of digital skill, confidence and access.&#xD;
2. Our team understands how to make their services or products accessible.&#xD;
3. Our team considers accessibility throughout the service design process.&#xD;
4. Research and testing are conducted to ensure our service is accessible to people of all abilities no matter how, where, or when they access the service.&#xD;
5. Our team conducts ongoing user research with users with low level digital literacy, people with disability, and people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.&#xD;
6. Our team implements automated accessibility checks for our services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team has no competency with accessibility and relies on another team to identify accessibility shortcomings.&#xD;
2. Accessibility compliance is added at the end of the development cycle in order to pass compliance checks or audits.</documentation>

      <documentation>Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
Make sure that staff have access to the tools, training and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build and operation of the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
To promote innovation and create agility within our organizations the teams that makeup our organizations must be empowered. Innovation increasingly flows from the bottom up rather than from the top down, and to benefit from this trend teams must be empowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Don’t hire good people to tell them what to do, hire good people to have them tell you what to do. The government manages large, highly complex and crucially important services for their users. A top-down command and control approach to service delivery and designs enforces a structure that aligns to the structure itself, rather than to the needs of the users, or based on the expertise of those building the services. Rather than bringing information to authority, bring authority to the information. Those best suited to solve a given problem, are those closest to the problem. By removing decision-making authority from the teams into complex governance structures, the innovative potential of teams is mitigated by legacy governance procedures and processes. To create organizations that can iterate and improve frequently, teams must be empowered to make decisions for themselves. Complex architectures that are responsive to the needs of users, including users within the organization, are emergent and are not derived through the compilation of hypotheses lacking the expertise of those closest to the complex problems needing to be solved. &#xD;
&#xD;

      <documentation>Be good data stewards&#xD;
Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held in a secure way so that it can easily be reused by others to provide services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Be good data stewards&#xD;
Good data stewardship is required to ensure data is clean, reusable, and managed responsibly to be leveraged for data driven decision making and promote reuse of information rather than duplication of efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
This involves managing data and information responsibly and securely, which supports the sharing and reuse of data throughout the Government of Canada and through promoting its use through innovative new solutions within the private sector. In alignment with working in the open by default, data and information should be published to be readable, by humans or by machines by publishing well organized data in machine readable formats. In alignment with iterating and improving frequently, efforts should be made to continually improve the quality of the data, and the quality of the processes used to manage and publish said data. Further, by working in the open by default and properly managing data and information sources, issues such as duplication of data and information and rework can be mitigated, while promoting the creation of innovative solutions which are able to leverage information collected and published by the government. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team strives to leverage data to continuously improve decision-making, operations, or service delivery.&#xD;

7. Our team has clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities for data and information management and use.&#xD;
8. Our team captures appropriate metadata to provide context for the information and data we create and capture, thereby enabling its discovery and reuse by others.&#xD;
9. Our team has processes in place to regularly assess, maintain, and improve data quality.&#xD;
10. Our service has in place processes for ensuring proper management of information and data prior to being collected, used, disclosed, retained, disposed of, or declassified.&#xD;
11. Our team ensures that information and data of business value are saved in systems where it can be properly managed.&#xD;
12. Our team has processes in place for determining the classification of data and information.&#xD;
13. Our team is aware of which information and data has business value and prioritizes its management.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team, or the service our team manages, asks users for the same information more than once.&#xD;
2. The service, or services, our team is responsible for collects all the data or information required without reusing existing data or information.&#xD;
3. The documentation for our APIs is only available to internal approved consumers.&#xD;
4. Our team does not have the data it needs to make informed policy, program, or service decisions.</documentation>

      <documentation>Design ethical services&#xD;
Make sure that everyone receives fair treatment. Comply with ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems which automate decision making (such as the use of artificial intelligence).&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Design ethical services&#xD;
Designing ethical systems means that systems created by the government ensures that everyone receives equitable treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Services should address client needs and provide public benefits. In the digital age, the underlying systems that run Canada’s services come to conclusions that can be opaque to both the external users, and those managing the systems. Efforts are required to increase the transparency and address potential biases of computational decisions, and to ensure that decisions made or supported using these systems are legal, consistent, accurate and align with the expectations and intents of those managing them. The responsible use of automated-decision systems includes being open about their use and being able to explain how decisions are made. Through iterative service design where results are continuously monitored against expected and desired outcomes, the organization positions itself to ensure it is designing ethical services. Furthermore, with extensive monitoring solutions, one must ensure their services are not enforcing biases, whether conscious or unconscious. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team continually seeks out indicators of bias and ensures their services are not reinforcing unintended biases.&#xD;
2. Our team continually seeks out evidence of unintended consequences to the user in service design and delivery and works to mitigate these consequences for the user.&#xD;
3. When automated decision-making is being leveraged by our team, possible biases in the data and algorithms are acknowledged, accounted for, and mitigated.&#xD;
4. Our team designs services which address cultural, linguistic, geographical, disability, technological, socioeconomic, or other access barriers to uptake.&#xD;
5. Our team has considered the impacts of decisions on the users and negative outcomes are reduced, when encountered.&#xD;
6. Our team uses data in a manner consistent with the purpose of its collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. No training is provided to our team regarding the potential impacts of the service they are designing or delivering.&#xD;
2. Our team conducts little to no monitoring of outcomes of the service to identify implicit bias.&#xD;
3. Our team delegates ethical analysis to a vendor or external service, without direct accountability to management.&#xD;
4. Our team designs and deliver services without fully considering relevant legislation&#xD;
5. Our team delivers services without assessing the impacts of negative outcomes.</documentation>

      <documentation>Collaborate widely&#xD;
Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Collaborate widely&#xD;
Collaborating widely allows us to learn from others to minimize mistakes already experienced and reduces work through identifying and sharing existing solutions. The problems that government solves are often unique, though they are not unique amongst governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Many of the same solutions by the same, or similar vendors, are used throughout the world, or at varying levels of government within different jurisdictions. When designing a service, or implementing a service using tools or systems, identify which other departments, jurisdictions, or organizations, have leveraged similar technologies to solve similar use cases in order to collaborate widely, reduce work, share solutions, and benefit from lessons already learned by others. Furthermore, using multidisciplinary teams, especially when coupled with the empowerment of staff, the government improves its posture to deliver modern and innovative services. Through wide collaboration, organizations begin to break down the silos developed over time through the overreliance on functionally based teams. Going forward, working across skill sets, and leveraging work from others, while learning from their lessons, promotes the development of modern services better able to meet the changing needs of citizens in the digital age.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team is multidisciplinary, having all the skills and capabilities required to fully deliver our service to users.&#xD;
2. Our team is active in communities of practice, events, or groups that pertain to the areas of expertise of team members.&#xD;
3. Our team has identified, and collaborates with, other teams, in or outside of our organisation, including other levels of government, other governments, the public, or private sector organizations, who have done, or are doing, similar work.&#xD;
4. Our team documents any APIs for our service using modern and common protocols and standards and provides examples to others regarding their use.&#xD;
5. Our team uses data from performance monitoring tools to inform business decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team develops most of the service on our own, without leveraging existing solutions and services to reduce duplication of effort.&#xD;
2. Our team overwhelmingly relies on tickets to manage collaboration between internal stakeholders or teams.&#xD;
3. The team does not consider the impacts on teams working across the value stream, or on the outcome of the service.</documentation>

[Implementing A.2.1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a21&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors require access to alternative content in order to interact with the web content that they are editing.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.2.1.1 Text Alternatives for Rendered Non-Text Content: If an editing-view renders non-text content, then any programmatically associated text alternatives for the non-text content can be programmatically determined. (Level A)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.1: (For the authoring tool user interface) Provide keyboard access to authoring features. [Implementing A.3.1]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors with limited mobility or visual disabilities do not use a mouse and instead require keyboard interface access to all of the functionality of the authoring tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.1.1 Keyboard Access (Minimum): All functionality of the authoring tool is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. (Level A)&#xD;
Note 1: Keyboard interfaces are programmatic services provided by many platforms that allow operation in a device independent manner. This success criterion does not imply the presence of a hardware keyboard.&#xD;
Note 2: The path exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input, but the underlying function (text input) does not. The path exception encompasses other input variables that are continuously sampled from pointing devices, including pressure, speed, and angle.&#xD;
Note 3: This success criterion does not forbid and should not discourage other input methods (e.g. mouse, touch) in addition to keyboard operation.&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.1&#xD;
A.3.1.2 No Keyboard Traps: If keyboard focus can be moved to a component using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface. If it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, authors are advised of the method for moving focus away. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.2&#xD;
A.3.1.3 Efficient Keyboard Access: The authoring tool user interface includes mechanisms to make keyboard access more efficient than sequential keyboard access. (Level AA)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.3&#xD;
A.3.1.4 Keyboard Access (Enhanced): All functionality of the authoring tool is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. (Level AAA)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.4&#xD;
A.3.1.5 Customize Keyboard Access: If the authoring tool includes keyboard commands, then those keyboard commands can be customized. (Level AAA)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.5&#xD;
A.3.1.6 Present Keyboard Commands: If the authoring tool includes keyboard commands, then the authoring tool provides a way for authors to determine the keyboard commands associated with authoring tool user interface components. (Level AAA)&#xD;

[Implementing A.3.2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a32&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors who have difficulty typing, operating the mouse, or processing information can be prevented from using systems with short time limits or that require fast reaction speeds, such as clicking on a moving target.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.2.1 Auto-Save (Minimum): The authoring tool does not include session time limits or the authoring tool can automatically save edits made before the session time limits are reached. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.2.1&#xD;
A.3.2.2 Timing Adjustable: The authoring tool does not include time limits or at least one of the following is true: (Level A)&#xD;
(a) Turn Off: Authors are allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or&#xD;
(b) Adjust: Authors are allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or&#xD;
(c) Extend: Authors are warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (e.g. &quot;press the space bar&quot;), and authors are allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or&#xD;
(d) Real-time Exception: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (e.g. a collaborative authoring system), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or&#xD;
(e) Essential Exception: The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or&#xD;
(f) 20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.&#xD;
Implementing A.3.2.2&#xD;
A.3.2.3 Static Input Components: The authoring tool does not include moving user interface components that accept input where the movement of these components cannot be paused by authors. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.2.3&#xD;
A.3.2.4 Content Edits Saved (Extended): The authoring tool can be set to automatically save web content edits made using the authoring tool. (Level AAA)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.4: (For the authoring tool user interface) Enhance navigation and editing via content structure. [Implementing A.3.4]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors who have difficulty typing or operating the mouse benefit when authoring tools make use of the structure present in web content to simplify navigating and editing the content.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.4.1 Navigate By Structure: If editing-views expose the markup elements in the web content being edited, then the markup elements (e.g. source code, content renderings) are selectable and navigation mechanisms are provided to move the selection focus between elements. (Level AA)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.4.1&#xD;
A.3.4.2 Navigate by Programmatic Relationships: If editing-views allow editing of programmatic relationships within web content, then mechanisms are provided that support navigation between the related content. (Level AAA)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.7: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that previews are at least as accessible as in-market user agents. [Implementing A.3.7]&#xD;
Rationale: Preview features are provided by many authoring tools because the workflow of authors often includes periodically checking how user agents will display the web content to end users. Authors with disabilities need the same opportunity to check their work.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.7.1 Preview (Minimum): If a preview is provided, then at least one of the following is true: (Level A)&#xD;
(a) In-Market User Agent: The preview renders content using a user agent that is in-market; or&#xD;
(b) UAAG (Level A): The preview conforms to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Level A [UAAG10].&#xD;

      <documentation>Part A Conformance Applicability Notes:&#xD;
Scope of &quot;authoring tool user interface&quot;: The Part A success criteria apply to all aspects of the authoring tool user interface that are concerned with producing the &quot;included&quot; web content technologies. This includes views of the web content being edited and features that are independent of the content being edited (e.g. menus, button bars, status bars, user preferences, documentation).&#xD;
Reflected content accessibility problems: The authoring tool is responsible for ensuring that editing-views display the web content being edited in a way that is more accessible to authors with disabilities (e.g. ensuring that text alternatives in the content can be programmatically determined). However, where an authoring tool user interface accessibility problem is caused directly by the content being edited (e.g. if an image in the content lacks a text alternative), then this would not be considered a deficiency in the accessibility of the authoring tool user interface.&#xD;
Developer control: The Part A success criteria only apply to the authoring tool user interface as it is provided by the developer. They do not apply to any subsequent modifications by parties other than the authoring tool developer (e.g. user modifications of default settings, third-party plug-ins).&#xD;
User agent features: Web-based authoring tools may rely on user agent features (e.g. keyboard navigation, find functions, display preferences, undo features) to satisfy success criteria. Conformance claims are optional, but any claim that is made must record the user agent(s).&#xD;
Accessibility of features provided to meet Part A: The Part A success criteria apply to the entire authoring tool user interface, including any features added to meet the success criteria in Part A (e.g. documentation, search functions). The only exemption is for preview features, as long as they meet the relevant success criteria in Guideline A.3.7. Previews are treated differently than editing-views because all authors, including those with disabilities, benefit when preview features accurately reflect the functionality of user agents that are actually in use by end users.&#xD;
Unrecognizable content: When success criteria require authoring tools to treat web content according to semantic criteria, the success criteria only apply when these semantics are encoded programmatically (e.g. text describing an image can only be considered a text alternatives for non-text content when this role is encoded within markup).</documentation>

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.6: (For the authoring tool user interface) Manage preference settings. [Implementing A.3.6]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors need to set their own display settings in a way that differs from the presentation that they want to define for the published web content. Providing the ability to save and reload sets of keyboard and display preference settings benefits authors who have needs that differ over time (e.g. due to fatigue).&#xD;

Part B Conformance Applicability Notes:&#xD;
Author availability: Any Part B success criteria that refer to authors only apply during authoring sessions.&#xD;
Developer control: The Part B success criteria only apply to the authoring tool as it is provided by the developer. This does not include subsequent modifications by parties other than the authoring tool developer (e.g. third-party plug-ins, user-defined templates, user modifications of default settings).&#xD;
Applicability after the end of an authoring session: Authoring tools are responsible for the web content accessibility (WCAG) of web content that they automatically generate after the end of an author's authoring session (see Success Criterion B.1.1.1). For example, if the developer changes the site-wide templates of a content management system, these would be required to meet the accessibility requirements for automatically-generated content. Authoring tools are not responsible for changes to the accessibility of content that the author causes, whether it is author-generated or automatically-generated by another system that the author has specified (e.g. a third-party feed).&#xD;
Authoring systems: As per the ATAG 2.0 definition of authoring tool, several software tools (identified in any conformance claim) can be used in conjunction to meet the requirements of Part B (e.g. an authoring tool could make use of a third-party software accessibility checking tool).&#xD;
Accessibility of features provided to meet Part B: The Part A success criteria apply to the entire authoring tool user interface, including any features that must be present to meet the success criteria in Part B (e.g. checking tools, repair tools, tutorials, documentation).&#xD;
Multiple authoring roles: Some authoring tools include multiple author roles, each with different views and content editing permissions (e.g. a content management system may separate the roles of designers, content authors, and quality assurers). In these cases, the Part B success criteria apply to the authoring tool as a whole, not to the view provided to any particular authoring role. Accessible content support features should be made available to any authoring role where it would be useful.&#xD;
Unrecognizable content: When success criteria require authoring tools to treat web content according to semantic criteria, the success criteria only apply when these semantics are encoded programmatically (e.g. text describing an image can only be considered a text alternatives for non-text content when this role is encoded within markup).</documentation>

      <documentation>Guideline B.1.1: Ensure that automatically-specified content is accessible. [Implementing B.1.1]&#xD;
Rationale: If authoring tools automatically produce web content that includes accessibility problems (WCAG), then this will impose additional repair tasks on authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.1.1.1 Content Auto-Generation After Authoring Sessions (WCAG): The authoring tool does not automatically generate web content after the end of an authoring session, or, authors can specify that the content be accessible web content (WCAG).

Implementing B.1.1.1&#xD;
B.1.1.2 Content Auto-Generation During Authoring Sessions (WCAG): If the authoring tool provides the functionality for automatically generating web content during an authoring session, then at least one of the following is true: (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
(a) Accessible: The content is accessible web content (WCAG) without author input; or&#xD;
(b) Prompting: During the automatic generation process, authors are prompted for any required accessibility information (WCAG); or&#xD;
(c) Automatic Checking: After the automatic generation process, accessibility checking is automatically performed; or&#xD;
(d) Checking Suggested: After the automatic generation process, the authoring tool prompts authors to perform accessibility checking.&#xD;
Note 1: Automatic generation includes automatically selecting templates for authors.&#xD;
Note 2: This success criterion applies only to automatic processes specified by the authoring tool developer. It does not apply when author actions prevent generation of accessible web content (WCAG).&#xD;

Note 2: This success criteria only applies when the output technology is &quot;included&quot; for conformance.&#xD;
Implementing B.1.2.1&#xD;
B.1.2.2 Copy-Paste Inside Authoring Tool (WCAG): If the authoring tool supports copy and paste of structured content, then any accessibility information (WCAG) in the copied content is preserved when the authoring tool is both the source and destination of the copy-paste and the source and destination use the same web content technology. (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Implementing B.1.2.2&#xD;
B.1.2.3 Optimizations Preserve Accessibility: If the authoring tool provides optimizing web content transformations, then any accessibility information (WCAG) in the input is preserved in the output. (Level A).&#xD;
Implementing B.1.2.3&#xD;
B.1.2.4 Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content are Preserved: If the authoring tool provides web content transformations that preserve non-text content in the output, then any text alternatives for that non-text content are also preserved, if equivalent mechanisms exist in the web content technology of the output.

Rationale: By guiding authors from the outset toward the creation and maintenance of accessible web content (WCAG), web content accessibility problems (WCAG) are mitigated and less repair effort is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.2.2.1 Accessible Option Prominence (WCAG): If authors are provided with a choice of authoring actions for achieving the same authoring outcome (e.g. styling text), then options that will result in accessible web content (WCAG) are at least as prominent as options that will not.

      <documentation>Guideline B.3.1: Assist authors in checking for accessibility problems. [Implementing B.3.1]&#xD;
Rationale: When accessibility checking is an integrated function of the authoring tool, it helps make authors aware of web content accessibility problems (WCAG) during the authoring process, so they can be immediately addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.3.1.1 Checking Assistance (WCAG): If the authoring tool provides authors with the ability to add or modify web content in such a way that a WCAG 2.0 success criterion can be violated, then accessibility checking for that success criterion is provided (e.g. an HTML authoring tool that inserts images should check for alternative text; a video authoring tool with the ability to edit text tracks should check for captions). (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Note: Automated and semi-automated checking is possible (and encouraged) for many types of web content accessibility problems (WCAG). However, manual checking is the minimum requirement to meet this success criterion. In manual checking, the authoring tool provides authors with instructions for detecting problems, which authors carry out by themselves. For more information on checking, see Implementing ATAG 2.0 - Appendix B: Levels of Checking Automation.&#xD;
Implementing B.3.1.1&#xD;
B.3.1.2 Help Authors Decide: If the authoring tool provides accessibility checking that relies on authors to decide whether potential web content accessibility problems (WCAG) are correctly identified (i.e. manual checking and semi-automated checking), then the accessibility checking process provides instructions that describe how to decide. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing B.3.1.2&#xD;
B.3.1.3 Help Authors Locate: If the authoring tool provides checks that require authors to decide whether a potential web content accessibility problem (WCAG) is correctly identified (i.e. manual checking and semi-automated checking), then the relevant content is identified to the authors. (Level A)&#xD;
Note: Depending on the nature of the editing-view and the scope of the potential web content accessibility problem (WCAG), identification might involve highlighting elements or renderings of elements, displaying line numbers, or providing instructions.&#xD;
Implementing B.3.1.3&#xD;
B.3.1.4 Status Report: If the authoring tool provides checks, then authors can receive an accessibility status report based on the results of the accessibility checks. (Level AA)&#xD;
Note: The format of the accessibility status report is not specified and they might include a listing of problems detected or a WCAG 2.0 conformance level, etc.&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.4.2: Ensure that documentation promotes the production of accessible content. [Implementing B.4.2]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors need support in determining how to use accessible content production features (e.g. how to respond to prompts for text alternatives, how to use accessibility checking tools). Demonstrating accessible authoring as routine practice, or at least not demonstrating inaccessible practices, will help to encourage acceptance of accessibility by some authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.4.2.1 Model Practice (WCAG): A range of examples in the documentation (e.g. markup, screen shots of WYSIWYG editing-views) demonstrate accessible authoring practices (WCAG). (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Implementing B.4.2.1&#xD;
B.4.2.2 Feature Instructions: Instructions for using any accessible content support features appear in the documentation. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing B.4.2.2&#xD;
B.4.2.3 Tutorial: The authoring tool provides a tutorial for an accessible authoring process that is specific to that authoring tool. (Level AAA)&#xD;
Implementing B.4.2.3&#xD;
B.4.2.4 Instruction Index: The authoring tool documentation contains an index to the instructions for using any accessible content support features. (Level AAA)&#xD;

Project Name: Learning Management System Renewal&#xD;
BizArch Lead IAG: Dan R&#xD;
&#xD;
Alignment to Strategy&#xD;
This project does support Accessibility Compliance legislation, Government of Canada Cloud first enablement approaches and guidelines and ESDC priorities of modernizing Human Resources Services and deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
BizArch Recommendations:&#xD;
This project presents several opportunities to implement a long term secure cloud based Learning Management Solution (LMS), meeting accessibility requirements, with potential to interoperate with other strategic HR and Business line IT/IM solutions. This will create a more enterpriseable solution to be reuse by many other solutions and supported for many years to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
BizArch Category: Life Cycle Management&#xD;
BizArch Category Reasoning: Business Architecture consider this project as a Life Cycle Management type of initiatives. It is replacing technology at end of vendor support (SABA) with newer technology supporting GC and ESDC priorities in accessibility and security to name a few.&#xD;
&#xD;
BizArch Criticality: Medium&#xD;
BizArch Criticality Reasoning: Business Architecture consider Criticality to Medium in view of the current solution that support most of the requirements and will still do so while this organization are addressing new concerns and priorities to be supported and implemented in the new solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
BizArch Alignment: Medium&#xD;
BizArch Alignment Reasoning: Accessible, Cloud based and Secure solution are priorities of both GC and ESDC. Please keep in mind that opportunities to interoperate with other HR related solutions should be considered as much as possible to be relevant in the future of this organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
BizArch Urgency: Medium&#xD;
BizArch Urgency Reasoning: August 2023 is the end of support of SABA. At this time, with a 24 months time frame to accomplish the transition to another solution is acceptable and doable.&#xD;

Section 1.2 IT Risk Analysis    &#xD;
Risk :Technical Debt There is a risk that ESDC does not have the ability to continuously operate, transform, and innovate to adequately deliver on the digital government priorities that support ESDC programs and services and ensure IT Service Continuity.    &#xD;
Response :. Mature and improve ESDC’s EA, supported by the creation of the departmental EA function and the launch of the Department’s EA Review Board, where EA will facilitate tracking the amount of technical debt against a set of portfolio level standards and/or targets and favour advancing EA-based projects that avoid increasing technical debt.  &#xD;

https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-operations-strategic-plans/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2021-2024.html&#xD;
Priority 1.1. Strengthen the overall health of the government’s application portfolio &#xD;
Several issues can weaken this health and lead to “technical debt.” Technical debt occurs when the vendor hasn’t upgraded and no longer supports an application, or when an application is so old that it’s hard to find people who have the skills to maintain it. In some cases, technical debt makes applications costly to maintain and at risk of performance and security failures. In other cases, it means that applications are too outdated to deliver fully digital services. </documentation>

Section 1.2&#xD;
Risk Service Delivery   &#xD;
There is a risk that ESDC will not be able to maintain the delivery of high-quality services while changing how it is delivering them.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Utilize the APM methodology to analyze, standardize and modernize IT applications, including:  &#xD;
develop multi-year plans to decommission and replace redundant application;   &#xD;
prioritize future IT investments based on risk mitigation, cost efficiency and reusability; and,  &#xD;
analyze and provide standardized direction for all IT enabled projects through ESDC’s EARB.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Utilize a holistic, multidimensional business view of capabilities and associated Business Architecture tools to better position the Department for effective service delivery to Canadians, such that:  &#xD;
investments and proposed investments are favourably aligned with identified priorities and strategies;   &#xD;
objectives are measurable and requirements traceable; and,  &#xD;
enterprise solutions are leveraged where possible to avoid duplication of effort.</documentation>

      <documentation>1.2.3.	Lessons learned in response to the Covid-19 response&#xD;
The experience of reporting on the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) has highlighted weaknesses in our data foundations.  Data gaps and a lack of clear and effective processes and procedures for data sharing and management delayed or prevented analysis of the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic on marginalized and racialized groups.  Reporting of summary data by province, age and gender was not achievable within timeframes required for rapid analysis and response.  Data from different parts of the department were in conflict, and executives did not have confidence in the quality of the data.  This proposal builds on the rapidly deployed assets CDO has created to address these urgent problems, and will help the department be prepared to quickly and accurately provide consistent and reliable answers to business questions by ensuring that data is ready, detailed and reliable to support reporting and analysis needs.</documentation>

      <documentation>In 2016, ISB completed an audit of the enforcement function that was executed by former Canada Revenu Agency (CRA) executive Dennis Meunier. This audit resulted in what has been termed the Meunier Report. The Meunier report provides 44 recommendations to ISB on how to improve the enforcement function and a related project – Enforcement as a Practice (EaaP) has been started to implement these improvements. The EaaP project has scheduled a Beta trial starting on June 7, 2021 and has requested that the electronic solution be in place so the software and new processes can be validated together.</documentation>

      <documentation>6.2.1	Option 1 – Status Quo&#xD;
The Status Quo option represents the continuation of Integrity Operations using the current suite of applications including SharePoint and the Compliance legacy application, the National Integrity Investigation System (NIIS) to provide basic tombstone and case data. Enforcement needs will continue to be addressed as follows:&#xD;
•	Enforcement functions will continue to be managed through a SharePoint site where case workload is assigned manually to regions;&#xD;
•	Minimal Business Intelligence (BI) and reporting capacity will be available as it is a manual process; &#xD;
•	Manual processes will need to be created to support work between Enforcement and Compliance;&#xD;
•	Manual processes will need to be created to satisfy the legal requirements for a successful prosecution when files are referred to PPSC or external police forces; Changes will be required to SharePoint and Excel to support the new manual processes.&#xD;
  &#xD;
Option Dependencies:  &#xD;
•	Current business needs are treated on a case-by-case fashion and limited to a defined scope of schedule, assigned resource level (less than $500K) and limited complexity. This is to limit the disruption impact on the legacy system, regional resources and Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) resources;&#xD;
•	The current SharePoint site and Excel sheets continue to operate properly;&#xD;
•	IITB are able to assign staff to create new SharePoint capabilities;&#xD;
•	The SharePoint and Excel capabilities are approved by the legal group as sufficient to support Enforcement moving forward; any new requirements can be met with SharePoint and Excel.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Assumptions: &#xD;
•	There are sufficient IITB staff available to perform the work efforts required to maintain and enhance the systems;&#xD;
•	Individuals with obsolete skill sets can be retained;&#xD;
•	Additional developmental requirements can be identified; and&#xD;
•	SharePoint and Excel can provide sufficient capabilities to match legal requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Constraints: &#xD;
•	The SharePoint site is not robust enough to handle all enforcement-related requirements including standardization, case automation objectives, and legal requirements necessary for referral to PPSC when prosecution is suitable;&#xD;
•	Without a modern toolset the National Enforcement and Intelligence Division (NEID) business process re-engineering might not fully achieve its expected level of outcome;&#xD;
•	There may not be sufficient IITB staff available to maintain or change the legacy systems;&#xD;
•	Although a very flexible tool, SharePoint and Excel may not be able to support the rigours required by the legal aspects of each case; and&#xD;
•	The Department’s plan does not include using SharePoint as a tool to support program level solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Feasibility: Not feasible&#xD;
Reasoning:  &#xD;
Option 1 – Status Quo, does not meet the criteria for supporting the commitment to implementing a robust enforcement system for the programs under ISB Integrity control. The cost to implement would require increasing staff within IITB and there could be scale-ability and adaptability issues by adding new features. It is not aligned with the strategic commitments of ISB and ESDC, and is not a sustainable model. It is therefore not a viable option. The use of the current system requires investigators to report multiple times, in different places, the same information for tracking and reporting purposes.  This is not an efficient use of valuable resources and a drain on efficiency and morale.&#xD;
ISB needs to be agile and be able to keep abreast of technology evolution and adapt its internal functions accordingly. &#xD;
Furthermore, as previously indicated, ISB’s investigations function continues to grow, particularly in the area of Enforcement. With the recent federal governments COVID-19 response plan, there will be increased opportunities for fraud and ISB will require robust systems and processes to discover and make referrals to LE  for eventual prosecution of such individuals. The existing SharePoint and Excel implementation has not been sufficient to handle the workload and many resources have been borrowed from the regions to deal with capacity. This demostrates and urgent need for a new system as the manual interventions required by the current system far outweigh the resources to manage them. The status quo poses significant challenges to workload management of investigation, intelligence gathering and security of information. Use of different systems impedes regional standardization and the ability to have a consistent approach for Integrity Operations across Canada, both increase the risk to successful prosecutions, and were challenges identified in the 2014 OAG audit of ESDC’s investigations framework.&#xD;
Option 1 rating against the evaluation criteria:&#xD;
1.	Delivery of an Enforcement solution by March 31, 2022 – some basic capabilities would be available by the due date but the development of SharePoint based Enforcement capabilities will continue after this date, there is uncertainty about the time required to deliver the entire solution;&#xD;
2.	Cost to implement, operate and retire solution –the cost to develop a solution may be higher than estimated as we do not know the entire timeframe for implementation;&#xD;
3.	Degree and timeliness of benefits realization – the implementation of a basic enforcement solution by the TBS due date will support some, but, not all of the outlined benefits within the required timeframe;&#xD;
4.	Risk associated with solution implementation and benefits realization – developing new code to provide a solution on the SharePoint product will have the additional risk to the project timeframe of having to test all new code and reject code that does not pass testing leading to a longer development schedule;&#xD;
5.	Implementation considerations – the IITB team will have to ensure sufficient knowledgeable resources are available to fulfill the Enforcement requirements on SharePoint;&#xD;
6.	Organizational readiness to adopt and take full advantage of solution – the Enforcement functionality within ISB is being revised, based on recommendations and the introduction of a new software solution will have to support the new business process revisions;&#xD;
7.	Ability to deliver on the following requirements : audit trail, data security, evidence security and compatibility with external agencies – the status quo does not support these requirements; and&#xD;
8.	Scalability of the solution and the adaptability to add new features in the future – the SharePoint system would use the newest technologies that have scalability and adaptability built in. New features will be added during subsequent releases of the solution.&#xD;

Preliminary Risk Identification&#xD;
The following preliminary risks have been identified for this option: &#xD;
Source of Risk 	Risk Definition / Context &#xD;
Internal – Business Requirements	The existing solution may not have the capabilities to meet all standard business requirements as the internal processes mature.&#xD;
Internal – Data migration	This option does not plan for any data migration. There is a risk that some migration may be required and has not been planned.&#xD;
Internal – Loss of Data	There is a risk that data may be lost if issues occur with the existing legacy systems before the replacement solution is available.&#xD;
Internal – Impact on Business (change management)	Implementing new system changes will modify existing operational processes, embedded culture and may disrupt established networks for staff.&#xD;
External – Interconnectivity	Program management between the Transformation Management Branch (TMB), Benefits and Integrated Services Branch (BISB) and the project-sponsoring branch must align to ensure interconnectivity between ongoing projects is in place.&#xD;
External – Interoperability	The existing solution does not have the capabilities to link to other datasets, systems and their existing state may cause some dis-benefits or require major workarounds for business operations.&#xD;
External – Stakeholder Engagement	Adopting an agile approach to support optimal documentation requires continued stakeholder involvement and is dependent on evolving priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implementation and Capacity Considerations&#xD;
Stakeholder Impacts:&#xD;
1.	ESDC and ISB will not receive any costs savings by modifiying the existing application;&#xD;
2.	Canadian Citizens will not experience increased fairness;&#xD;
3.	IITB Development staff will obtain no new skills;&#xD;
4.	ESDC Personnel – ISB-NHQ and regional staff will continue to spend more time processing each case and have minimal case management with supported automation, reporting, and business rules;&#xD;
5.	ESDC personnel – Regional Integrity Operations will have no consistency in the delivery of  services and processes;&#xD;
6.	ESDC Personnel will be using an outdated application that does not provide the following software product qualities – Functional Suitability, Reliability, Performance efficiency, Operability, Security, Compatibility, Maintainability and Portability;&#xD;
7.	IITB Development staff will be impacted by the inability to retain programmers and systems analyst talent;&#xD;
8.	Benefit Delivery Service Branch will have minimal reliability on the data provided by the existing Application; and&#xD;
9.	External LE Agencies will see minimal improvement in the cases provided by ESDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
Project Management Capacity:&#xD;
Over the last fiscal year, ISB has created a Project Delivery Office (PDO) to centralize the function and to help increase its overall maturity level in Project Management (PM). Specifically, for this project, ISB has assigned a Project Manager, two Deputy Project Managers, change management and business analysis staff to this effort. Between them, the project will have over thirty years of project experience and more than ten years of ISB experience. &#xD;
The project will be tracked using the ESDC PM framework, with the associated support from ESDC’s Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO). ESDC executives will be kept informed of the project progress by monthly dashboard reporting and the necessary project-gating process.&#xD;
The solution development will be undertaken by IITB, who will be assigning a technical manager to coordinate the development efforts. A project governance approach between IITB, ISB and regional executives will be implemented with a focus on team integration, transparency between enablers, and decisive issue resolution approach between responsible executives.&#xD;
The solution will be developed using an Agile PM approach. The list of user requirements will be tracked and software development will occur during a series of “Sprints”. The timeframes for each sprint will be defined by IITB and new software will be provided at the end of each sprint. Using an Agile process allows the development team to provide a solution quicker to the user community and tailor their development efforts on the most critical or required changes.&#xD;
Lessons learned from the development and deployment of the TFWP/IMP ICMS system has, and will continue to be leveraged. One of the key project success points was the high integration between program, project and technical resources.&#xD;
Based on the implementation and capacity listed above, the ability to implement the option is rated as High.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
Organizational Readiness Analysis&#xD;
The following concerns have been identified regarding readiness of ISB to adopt and take full advantage of this solution option:&#xD;
Organizational Readiness Considerations&#xD;
1.	ISB is currently executing an initiative to define the business model to process Enforcement cases;&#xD;
2.	Involvement from the ISB regional community, with the ongoing enforcement project, has been at the levels and effort that ISB requires to complete the work. Regional and NHQ staff have bought into the proposed changes to support the new Enforcement model and ISB expects this level of commitment to continue;&#xD;
3.	Within the ISB department, this project and associated Enforcement Maturity Model work, has a high priority and staff are available as required and sufficient funding is in place to support both efforts; and&#xD;
4.	The ISB team has a dedicated Change Management group who will ensure that the end-user community will be informed of the proposed changes and will have the necessary training to support the system moving forward.&#xD;
Based on the organizational readiness considerations above, the organizational readiness to adopt this option is rated as High.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Enforcement function&#xD;
Currently, the Enforcement division utilizes a SharePoint site developed as a response to the critical shortcomings and abandonment of the Major Investigation and Sensitive Case Information System (MISCIS) as a case management system. MISCIS was an MS-Access database with limited functionality that did not meet business objectives. In addition, this solution had no workflow management and was not designed to be a case management system or a long-term solution to respond to current operational risks. An internal audit conducted by ISB in 2014 outlined the immediate need to develop and implement a robust and comprehensive case management system to manage the increase of enforcement investigations, aligned to key stages of the investigation workflow, and to help provide a framework for the separation of Enforcement and Compliance functions§. The report also highlighted the importance in consistency of evidence building in our processes.</documentation>

      <documentation>6.2.2	Option 2 – Developing required functionality in ISB’s existing case management system (NIIS)&#xD;
Option Description&#xD;
This option requires assigning resources to work on the NIIS system, contrary to current departmental priorities. Development would be performed in house using existing IT resources. Changes would include:&#xD;
•	Making changes to the automated workload distribution module to address EI, CPP and OAS enforcement work distribution requirements;&#xD;
•	Database changes to handle the new data imported into the system;&#xD;
•	Developing a screen that would display the EI, CPP/OAS and SIN data that would be imported to the system;&#xD;
•	Develop mechanisms for automated loading of data/cases being referred to ISB from Information Collection and Synthesis Team (ICST);&#xD;
•	Development of actions/forms/correspondence to address work related to Enforcement;&#xD;
•	Creating a fraud module to handle criminal investigations and enforcement; and&#xD;
•	Integration with the Information Technology Renewal Delivery System (ITRDS) – the CPP system of record.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Dependencies:  &#xD;
•	Current business needs are treated on a case-by-case fashion and limited to a defined scope of schedule, assigned resource level (less than $500K) and limited complexity. This is to limit the disruptive impact on the legacy system and IITB resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Assumptions:  &#xD;
•	There are sufficient IITB staff available to perform the work efforts required to maintain the systems;&#xD;
•	The department is committed to supporting these older applications for 10+ years;&#xD;
•	Individuals with the obsolete skill sets can be retained; and&#xD;
•	The mainframe will be decommissioned when BDM is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Constraints:  &#xD;
•	There may not be sufficient IITB staff available to perform the work effort;&#xD;
•	Knowledgeable and trained individuals to perform this work are not readily available and the cost to hire and train individuals is too high;&#xD;
•	The equipment used to execute the applications is near end-of-life and may not be operational in 10+ years; difficulty in sourcing replacement parts;&#xD;
•	Individuals with the obsolete skill sets may not be available; and&#xD;
•	The Department’s plan may not allow modifications to these older applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
Feasibility: Not Feasible&#xD;
 &#xD;
Reasoning:  &#xD;
Option 2 meets the immediate need for supporting the commitment of implementing a robust enforcement system to support the EI, CPP/OAS and SIN programs Enforcement needs. Yet, this option goes against the current transformation effort and IT renewal initiatives undertaken in the last 10 years at ESDC. The cost to implement the system modification within NIIS would require an increase in IITB resources, adding systems and staff risks. The existing NIIS system may not be able to deliver on all key requirements and may not meet the enforcement deadline of March 31, 2022. The existing system is therefore only a partially viable option.&#xD;
Option 2 rating against the evaluation criteria:&#xD;
1.	Delivery of an Enforcement solution by March 31, 2022 – minimal capabilities would be available by the due date but the development of Enforcement capabilities would not be completed and it is uncertain that the system can be modified to support the new Enforcement requirements;&#xD;
2.	Cost to implement, operate and retire solution – the cost to develop a solution may be higher than estimated as we do not know the entire timeframe for implementation;&#xD;
3.	Degree and timeliness of benefits realization – the implementation of some basic enforcement capabilities by the TBS due date will support some, but, not all, of the outlined benefits within the required timeframe;&#xD;
4.	Risk associated with solution implementation and benefits realization – as the development will be completed using older technology, there is a risk of delays to the timeline and capabilities provided;&#xD;
5.	Implementation considerations – the IITB team will have to ensure sufficient knowledgeable resources are available to fulfill the Enforcement requirements on the existing platform;&#xD;
6.	Organizational readiness to adopt and take full advantage of solution – the Enforcement functionality within ISB is being revised, based on recommendations and the introduction of a new software solution will not match the revision timeframes;&#xD;
7.	Ability to deliver on the following requirements: audit trail, data security, evidence security and compatibility with external agencies – the solution would be developed to deliver full audit trails, enhance data security and improve the data provided to external agencies, but, the timeframe will be extended as the project will require additional releases in addition to the original release; and&#xD;
8.	Scalability of the solution and the adaptability to add new features in the future – it is uncertain if the existing application can provide the scalability and adaptability required to support the new Enforcement capabilities.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Plateau" name="Option 3: Onboard To Integrity Case Management System (ICMS)" id="id-5ccba12a24f64888a4e8687511bdb854">
      <documentation>6.2.3	Option 3 – Onboarding to the Integrity Case Management System (ICMS). &#xD;
Option Description:  &#xD;
This option consists of configuring the required changes to support the commitment of implementing a robust enforcement system for the EI program and the Pensions program (CPP and OAS). This option consists of starting with an instance of the existing ICMS Microsoft (MS) Dynamics system and configuring workflows for each specific program and function. There would need to be a secure wall between enforcement and the TFW/IMP/Compliance work and ISB would need to assign special roles and access to Enforcement data has to be guaranteed to be locked down. This will allow ISB to have a common case management system across its functional delivery network and leverage existing knowledge, expertise, processes, and tools to create a synergy across programs. This option builds on the success of developing a robust case management system for the TFWP and the IMP. Quality monitoring and control will be incorporated within the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
This option will allow ISB to leverage the enterprise system and acquired knowledge obtained during the first phase of the project. Undertaking the configuration in-house, therefore reduces the dependency on external suppliers, and continues to build the confidence and expertise achieved during the first phase of the Modernization of Integrity Case Management (MICM). This option will also allow building additional knowledge about case management within ESDC to ensure sustainability of the developed product, and therefore reduce maintenance cost in the long term. &#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, onboarding all ISB’s programs to the same system ensures a common transition plan for the long-term transformation objectives of ESDC. As ESDC moves forward with innovative service delivery methods, ISB would realize economies of scale by having a common system for the delivery of all its services. &#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, senior developers that configured the ICMS are the same that currently maintain NIIS. This in-house expertise has gained business knowledge and deep understanding in development of investigative-oriented tools and this expertise can be leveraged. &#xD;
&#xD;
Option Dependencies: &#xD;
•	IITB areas continue to have IT capacity to develop automated data and information transfers to ISB.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Assumptions:  &#xD;
•	Government supports the established direction and visions on technology transformations; and &#xD;
•	Government supports moving forward with enterprise solutions and standard applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Constraints:  &#xD;
•	A shortage of key subject experts (program or technical) dedicated to the project could impact the project schedule and timelines;&#xD;
•	The ICMS solution will be reviewed to understand if the application may/may not be able to support the required documentation and processing standards required by the Enforcement team;&#xD;
•	The ICMS solution will be reviewed to understand if the application may/may not be able to attach images, video files, audio files, scanned documents, photos, etc. with the required security and tracking. We need to keep in mind the full suite of requirements for prosecution which also includes change tracking, security of data and evidence recording and tracking;&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
Feasibility: Feasible but not recommended&#xD;
Reasoning:  &#xD;
Option 3 rating against the following evaluation criteria:&#xD;
1.	Delivery of an Enforcement solution by March 31, 2022 – the project would be unable to deliver the basic Enforcement capabilities by the due date; Enhanced capabilities could be delivered in future releases;&#xD;
2.	Cost to implement, operate and retire solution – MICM2 cost is defined below; the cost to develop a solution could be higher than purchasing software;&#xD;
3.	Degree and timeliness of benefits realization – the implementation of a basic enforcement solution by the TBS due date will support some, but, not all, of the outlined benefits within the required timeframe;&#xD;
4.	Risk associated with solution implementation and benefits realization – developing a solution on a COTS product will have additional risks than purchasing a purpose-built solution due to the development of new code;&#xD;
5.	Implementation considerations – a similar application was successfully implemented for TFWP and IMP from the MICM project. ISB is using the lessons learned from that project to improve our delivery capabilities with this new project;&#xD;
6.	Organizational readiness to adopt and take full advantage of solution – the Enforcement functionality within ISB is being revised, based on recommendations and the introduction of a new software solution will be closely tied to the revision timeframes;&#xD;
7.	Ability to deliver on the following requirements: audit trail, data security, compatibility with external agencies – the solution will be developed to deliver full audit trails, enhance data security and improve the data provided to external agencies, but, the project will require additional releases in addition to the original release; and&#xD;
8.	Scalability of the solution and the adaptability to add new features in the future – the ICMS system would use the newest technologies that have scalability and adaptability built in.&#xD;

Preliminary Risk Identification&#xD;
The following preliminary risks have been identified for this option: &#xD;
Source of Risk 	Risk Definition / Context &#xD;
Internal – Business Requirements	Validating existing requirements in the system to identify whether they apply to the new system may be more complex than anticipated.&#xD;
Internal – Data migration	For transition, migration of existing legacy data including case status may be more complex than anticipated.&#xD;
Internal – Impact on Business (change management)	Implementing a new system will change existing operational processes and embedded culture and may disrupt established networks for staff.&#xD;
External – Interconnectivity	Program management between the TMB, BISB and the project-sponsoring branch must align to ensure interconnectivity between ongoing projects is in place.&#xD;
External – Interoperability	The capabilities to link to other datasets, systems and their existing state may cause some dis-benefits or require major workarounds for business operations.&#xD;
External – Stakeholder Engagement	Adopting an agile approach to support optimal documentation requires continued stakeholder involvement and is depending on evolving priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implementation and Capacity Considerations&#xD;
Stakeholder Impacts:&#xD;
1.	ESDC and ISB will receive a positive impact from the costs savings for implementation of new systems and increased efficiency in the handling of compliance and enforcement cases within the affected programs;&#xD;
2.	Canadian Citizens will experience increased fairness due to the added investigational coverage and consistent delivery processes;&#xD;
3.	IITB Development staff will be positively impacted by the new skills they will learn and the ability to support current equipment and software solutions;&#xD;
4.	ESDC Personnel – ISB-NHQ and regional staff will have an application that will enable case management with supported automation, such as auto-distribution, reporting, and business rules;&#xD;
5.	ESDC personnel – Regional Integrity Operations will have a consistency in the delivery of modern services and processes;&#xD;
6.	ESDC Personnel will be using an application that provides the following software product qualities – Functional Suitability, Reliability, Performance efficiency, Operability, Security, Compatibility, Maintainability and Portability;&#xD;

9.	External LE Agencies will be impacted by the consistent service and cases provided by ESDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
Project Management Capacity:&#xD;
Over the last fiscal year, ISB has created a PDO to centralize the function and to help increase its overall maturity level in PM. Specifically, for this project, ISB has assigned a Project Manager, two Deputy Project Managers, change management and business analysis staff to this effort. Between them, the project will have thirty years of project experience and more than ten years of ISB experience. &#xD;
The project will be tracked using the ESDC PM framework, with the associated support from ESDC’s EPMO. ESDC executives will be kept informed of the project progress by monthly dashboard reporting and the necessary project-gating process.&#xD;
The solution implementation will be monitored by IITB, who will be assigning a technical manager to coordinate the efforts. A project governance approach between IITB, ISB and regional executives will be implemented with a focus on team integration, transparency between enablers, and decisive issue resolution approach between responsible executives.&#xD;
Lessons learned from the development and deployment of the TFWP/IMP ICMS system has, and will continue to be leveraged. One of the key project success points was the high integration between program, project and technical resources.&#xD;
Based on the implementation and capacity listed above, the ability to implement the option is rated as High.&#xD;
&#xD;
Organizational Readiness Analysis&#xD;
The following concerns have been identified regarding readiness of ISB to adopt and take full advantage of this solution option:&#xD;
Organizational Readiness Considerations&#xD;
1.	ISB is currently executing an initiative to define the business model to process Enforcement cases;&#xD;
2.	Involvement from the ISB regional community, with the ongoing enforcement project, has been at the levels and effort that ISB requires to complete the work. Regional and NHQ staff have bought into the proposed changes to support the new Enforcement model and ISB expects this level of commitment to continue;&#xD;
3.	Within the ISB department, this project and associated Enforcement Maturity Model work, has a high priority and staff are available as required and sufficient funding is in place to support both efforts; and&#xD;
4.	The ISB team has a dedicated Change Management group who will ensure that the end-user community will be informed of the proposed changes and will have the necessary training to support the system moving forward.&#xD;
Based on the organizational readiness considerations above, the organizational readiness to adopt this option is rated as High.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Plateau" name="Option 4: Specialized Enforcement COTS or SaaS" id="id-76a9943b97e24fc7815e6fdd9d66e2ca">
      <documentation>6.2.4	Option 4 – Selecting a third-party vendor off-the-shelf product or Software as a Solution (SaaS) implementation that is specialized in the enforcement work space&#xD;
Option Description:  &#xD;
This option consists of creating high-level requirements, developing and distributing a Request for Proposal (RFP) with associated evaluation criteria and rating analysis, accepting proposals from external vendors or system integrators, and selecting a third-party software solution. Once selected, the winning bidder’s solution is to be acquired and implemented to IT-enable the enforcement functions for the EI, CPP, OAS, SIN programs and associated Quality Control (QC) business functions. The implementation will also consist of developing the associated level of access, workload and case management functionality. IITB will be involved to determine the best approach establish physical IT gateways and interfaces between a COTS enforcement product and other systems within the departments (if required).&#xD;
In an attempt to contain costs, ISB would use the out-of-box functionalities and map/modify internal business processes to match the selected solution and then develop the necessary interfaces to other systems as required. &#xD;
Option Dependencies: &#xD;
A third-party solution that meets the Enforcement requirements, which can be acquired within an acceptable timeframe and within a reasonable implementation schedule, priority could be given to a Software as a Service (SaaS) implementation as this will shorten the overall implementation schedule. However, there are privacy and security concerns that will have to be assessed to ensure ISB could proceed with a SaaS implementation.&#xD;
•	There will be heavy reliance on the vendor to provide configuration, build and deployment services including stabilization; and&#xD;
•	Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) will be involved for contract award including the solution, implementation and 10 years of support.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Assumptions:  &#xD;
•	Third-party vendors have IT capacity to provide training on how to use, develop or configure the selected application, if required; ISB will also need to provide training on our own processes independent of the actual software; &#xD;
•	The processes for Enforcement are detailed and stable enough to facilitate the configuration of the selected solution;&#xD;
•	The selected solution will fit within an approved Government of Canada (GoC) or ESDC systems environment;&#xD;
•	IITB is not constrained by existing delivery commitments so as to be able to deliver interface capabilities that connect between the new solution and existing ISB systems, if required;&#xD;
•	The out-of-box functionality meets the minimum requirements for Enforcement;&#xD;
•	Development of new interfaces is supported by the solution, ISB will perform a technical assessment and make initial inquiries with potential vendors to determine if this is even possible;&#xD;
•	Option to validate the product features before program-wide deployment by using a Beta test period; and &#xD;
•	There is support to use other-than-government standard applications and no internal governance exceptions are required or triggered.&#xD;
Option Constraints:  &#xD;
•	The processing time and resource availability to complete the Request for Information (RFI), RFP and other procurement activities;&#xD;
•	The selected solution may not be customizable;&#xD;
•	ISB may need to negotiate support and design configuration with vendor; and&#xD;
•	ISB may have to modify business processes and procedures to fit the capabilities of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
Feasibility: Feasible and recommended.&#xD;
Reasoning:  &#xD;
Option 4 rating against the following evaluation criteria:&#xD;
1.	Delivery of an Enforcement solution by March 31, 2022 – the project would focus on delivering the full product suite by the due date; &#xD;
2.	Cost to implement, operate and retire solution – the cost to purchase a solution is expected to be lower than developing a solution;&#xD;
3.	Degree of and timeliness of benefits realization – the implementation of an enforcement solution by the TBS due date will support accomplishment of the outlined benefits within the required timeframe; &#xD;
4.	Risk associated with solution implementation and benefits realization – the purchasing on an off-the-shelf software solution will minimize the risks associated with tailoring or developing a proprietary solution;&#xD;
5.	Implementation considerations – purchasing a COTS application will allow ISB to purchase the appropriate servers and database to support the application with our original release, if required. If the selected software is available in a SaaS environment, we will be recommending this approach as it will minimize the purchasing of servers, etc.;&#xD;
6.	Organizational readiness to adopt and take full advantage of solution – the Enforcement functionality within ISB is being revised, based on the recommendations and the introduction of a new software solution will be closely tied to the revised timeframes;&#xD;
7.	Ability to deliver on the following requirements: audit trail, data security, compatibility with external agencies – these requirements will be used as the rating criteria during product selection and we will be selecting a product that meets most requirements; and&#xD;
8.	Scalability of the solution and the adaptability to add new features in the future – the CMS selected will use best practices and be most suitable for ISB case processing and integration needs that have scalability and adaptability built in.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Plateau" name="Option 5: Wait For Benefits Delivery Modernization (BDM) To Implement" id="id-348a0c4089f040208bc958c7f10c2def">
      <documentation>6.2.5	Option 5 – Wait for the implementation of the Benefits Delivery Modernization Program. &#xD;
Option Description:  &#xD;
This option consists of putting this project on hold while ESDC completes the BDM. ESDC is working on the BDM program and this program will support the EI, CPP, and OAS programs in the future. ISB could decide to wait for the implementation of BDM and then migrate the existing (legacy) systems to the new solution at that time. Based on information received at the time of this writing, although this approach is feasible, it would not meet the TBS requirement to have an Enforcement solution in place by March 31, 2022. &#xD;
&#xD;
Thus, waiting for the completion of the BDM program is not recommended due to timing constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Dependencies: &#xD;
•	Due to the limited knowledge of the BDM solution, we cannot add any dependencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Assumptions:  &#xD;
•	Due to the limited knowledge of the BDM solution, we cannot add an assumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
Option Constraints:  &#xD;
•	Due to the limited knowledge of the BDM solution, we cannot add any constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
Feasibility: Feasible but not recommended&#xD;
Reasoning:  &#xD;
Option 5 rating against the following evaluation criteria:&#xD;
1.	Delivery of an Enforcement solution by March 31, 2022 – this approach cannot deliver by the due date;&#xD;
2.	Cost to implement, operate and retire solution – the cost to develop the solution is unknown at this time as no service provider has been contracted;&#xD;
3.	Degree and timeliness of benefits realization – it is unknown at this time if BDM solution would realize the defined benefits;&#xD;
4.	Risk associated with solution implementation and benefits realization – waiting for the completion of BDM will add additional risks to the daily operations of the department and could result in the loss of data due to the age of the equipment and case processing delays;&#xD;
5.	Implementation considerations – it is unknown at this time what the implementation considerations are for the BDM solution;&#xD;
6.	Organizational readiness to adopt and take full advantage of solution – it is unknown at this time what the nature of the BDM solution and therefore we cannot comment on the organizational readiness;&#xD;
7.	Ability to deliver on the following requirements— audit trail, data security, compatibility with external agencies — due to our limited knowledge on the BDM solution we are unable to state if all key requirements will be delivered; and&#xD;
8.	Scalability of the solution and the adaptability to add new features in the future – due to our limited knowledge on the BDM solution we are unable to comment on the scalability of the solution.&#xD;

&#xD;
Over a year ago, the development and execution of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Strategy and Roadmap began. Since we are now at the end of the Roadmap’s first phase, Horizon 1, it’s worth asking whether we have successfully addressed those irritants affecting EA's capability to deliver organizational value efficiently and effectively. Have we focused on putting the “EA house in order” so it can become a trusted advisor in assisting and advising the organization in strategic, tactical and operational directions and decisions?&#xD;
Given the numerous COVID-19 challenges and setbacks experienced so far,EA has made great progress on the Horizon 1 Roadmap activities. &lt;Its achievements include:>&#xD;
&#xD;
Unexpected challenges this year led Roadmap Leads to adjust course to capitalizefully on the Roadmap’s value. To that end, these leads will be holding review and adjustment sessions with the different Enterprise Architecture (EA) domains in the coming weeks.&#xD;
During these unprecedented times, EA employees should know that the team responsible for the Strategy and Roadmap has heard you and understands that the following challenges directly affect the realization of your planned Horizon 1 activities: &lt;Horizon 1 Constraints></documentation>

Wave 3 is due to happen on the weekend of September 2nd to September 6th, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
Countdown to Migration &#xD;
The Project Team will migrate your site over a weekend – from Friday night to Sunday night. Before migration starts, your SharePoint 2010 site will be converted to Read Only. Plan for you site to be in Read Only mode for 4 days – from Wednesday night to Sunday night.  &#xD;
We will provide a message template you can use to alert your site contributors and visitors ahead of your site’s conversion to Read Only &#xD;
You can still view all site contents while in Read Only &#xD;
You will not be able to change or add content after it is converted to Read Only. If you need to work on a document, you will need to save it in a different location and then upload it to your site in SharePoint Online, after migration is complete.</documentation>

&#xD;
Validate and GO! &#xD;
Your Remediation Items checklist may include tasks to complete when your site is in SharePoint Online. In addition to any rebuilding of functionality after your site contents have been replicated in your new SharePoint Online environment, you should check that your contents and their metadata (e.g. Created, Created By, Modified By etc.) have moved successfully, by comparing them with the SharePoint 2010 source. This comparison should include actual content itself and the metadata associated with it. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Your SharePoint Online site is live as soon as migration is complete. Before you advise your site contributors and visitors your site is ready for use, be sure to review it to make sure it is working the way you expected. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Expect some final reminders from the Project Team to guide you through these last steps.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Post-Migration Message from the Project Team 	Confirms your migration status with a reminder to validate your site .&#xD;
Final Project Team Message 	A final message that includes a message template for owners to copy/paste and send to their site contributors/visitors .&#xD;
Owner Experience Survey 	We need your insight and feedback! Help us enhance the experience for owners in future migration waves. </documentation>

The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique.

The defence of the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, and the defence of the rights of the Anglophone minority within Quebec, is a priority for the Government.&#xD;
The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique. There are almost 8 million Francophones in Canada within a region of over 360 million inhabitants who are almost exclusively Anglophone. The Government therefore has the responsibility to protect and promote French not only outside of Quebec, but also within Quebec.</documentation>

Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.</documentation>

Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.</documentation>

These terms have been circulating since the inception of the EA Strategy and Roadmap. As Lean-Agile leaders, we need to drive and sustain organizational change and operational excellence by empowering individuals and teams to reach their highest potential.&#xD;

Becoming a “Lean” enterprise is neither simple nor easy. Business agility requires anew approach to leadership. To inspire and motivate you to pursue a better way of working, below are the principles of the SAFe Lean-Agile Mindset.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;The leaders of companies set the tone and direction for thepeople. Hypocrites, liars, and self-interested leaders createcultures filled with hypocrites, liars, and self-interested employees. The leaders of companies who tell the truth, in contrast, will create a culture of people who tell the truth. It is not rocket science. We follow the leader.&quot;&#xD;

      <documentation>Barriers can hinder the Enterprise Architecture (EA) discipline at ESDC. In theface of such adversity, we need to confront these hurdles to pave the way for the digital government transformation journey.&#xD;
&#xD;
“There is a need for a paradigm shift in the way we define and deliver change in the organization. We need to weigh our decisions based on their value to clients and key stakeholders, and be outcome-drivenin our design approach to ensure that our changes are properly scoped and laser-focused. Changes should be considered across the enterprise to ensure that there is always common value derived from investments. We must also ensure that we are not reinforcing silos and creating disparate architectures, essentially sacrificing long-term business agility for short-term project agility. Adopting an approach that takes all of this into consideration is key and needs to be ingrained in the way we do business to ensure future success.”- Kevin Herman (Manager, Business Architecture)&#xD;
&#xD;
As EA practitioners, we need to remember that we are master change agents, and innovative and out-of-box thinkers. Moving forward, architects will need strong business skills and a proficiency in human interactions to guide investments and decisions across business and IT. This will allow the organization to create value by exploiting new digital government/business opportunities and innovation.</documentation>

Data integration projects are often conceived at a high level; for example, “Following the merger with our major rival, we will have a large, combined customer base to which we will market our products”. Such simple high-level statements typically omit to mention some difficult problems that Technical Architects and Data Architects must solve. For example, the major rival may well identify its customers in a different way to the group that it is joining, and collect different information about them.&#xD;

Working in the open is something we should all strive to get accustomed with. As public servants, this is a unique opportunity to change our mindset and get closer to the people we work for as well as to increase the chances of reusing existing ideas and solutions instead of starting from scratch.&#xD;
&#xD;
On the topic of reusability, which probably should be its own post, it’s important to realize that various jurisdictions have very similar needs and challenges, yet we work in isolation by default given our varied levels of responsibilities, mandates, and legislations. A few examples could be around signing in a government account (or many!), creating web forms, displaying web content in an accessible manner, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are many articles and research exploring this topic so here are a few links if you are interested. Needless to say that public administrations in general are ripe for reusing solutions and ideas to increase the quality of their services to citizens!

SharePoint Permission Levels&#xD;
The first step to managing permissions in SharePoint is to understand what actions the various permission levels authorize a person to perform. As a DesignerPlus, you will be granting the Read, Contribute and Design permission levels to people using your SharePoint site – the rest of the permission levels are described for your information only. &#xD;

      <documentation>Zero Trust Capabilities&#xD;
The Digital Age does not give us the luxury of time to meet the requirements using traditional network-based solutions, or individualized, interface, or per client, vendor, or supplier-level integrations; nor can we predict what changes it will bring. Zero Trust helps prevent lengthy audits in order to meet organizational needs.&#xD;
Zero Trust provides organizations with a modern information security paradigm able to meet the capabilities that can support those requirements. Figure 4 describes the key capabilities.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Grouping" name="Zero Trust Core Principles (Grouping)" id="id-a4f15e742f054f988ea77e4c0718be9b">
      <documentation>Core Principles&#xD;
When organizations undertake the journey towards a new, enterprise-wide change, a core set of principles7 provides a succinct, easily shared “North Star” to guide and coalesce the organization.&#xD;
This set of Core Principles acts as a set of fundamental guidelines for organizations to adopt Zero Trust and implement ZTAs. They focus on factors specific to Zero Trust – linking people, processes, and technology – and should both be used for all new security initiatives and retroactively applied to old security activities.&#xD;
The Core Principles are grouped into common themes that address different aspects of Zero Trust:&#xD;
• Organizational Value and Risk Alignment principles address key goals for business, IT, and security stakeholders to address overall strategic drivers&#xD;
• Guardrails and Governance principles address compliance, risk, and information security stakeholders to guide the adoption of Zero Trust and ensure sustainability of assurances, addressing:&#xD;
— Rapidly evolving compliance and regulatory needs, requiring proactive integration of industry and organizational controls&#xD;
— Lagging industry controls and compliance standards, resulting in an expectation to create supplemental organizational controls&#xD;
— Increasing complexity and agility requirements that drive the need for rapid, near real-time or real-time audits, requiring automation of data collection, traceability, and processes&#xD;
• Technology principles address the IT organization, information security, and risk and compliance stakeholders and determine technology decisions that underlie the development of a ZTA, including concerns associated with identity, access, and reduced threat surface area&#xD;
• Security Controls principles address security and IT architects to ensure strong foundations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances&#xD;
All of the elements of the Core Principles must fit within the business strategy and organizational culture. Simple axioms are provided below to aid in communicating and remembering the principles. Guardrails and Governance help bind business goals and technical reality, and these principles are depicted to the side in Figure 7 as they should not impede direct connections between the organizational mission and the technology and security that support it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Figure 7: Summary of Zero Trust Core Principles&#xD;
Organizational Value and Risk Alignment&#xD;
1. Modern Work Enablement – Users8 in organizational ecosystems must be able to work on any network in any location with the same security assurances, increasing productivity.&#xD;
2. Goal Alignment – Security must align with and enable organization goals within risk tolerance and threshold.&#xD;
3. Risk Alignment – Security risk must be managed and measured consistently using the organization’s risk framework and considering organizational risk tolerance and thresholds.&#xD;
Guardrails and Governance&#xD;
4. People Guidance and Inspiration – Organizational governance frameworks must guide people, process, and technology decisions with clear ownership of decisions, policy, and aspirational visions.&#xD;
5. Risk and Complexity Reduction – Governance must both reduce complexity (i.e., simplify) and reduce threat surface area.&#xD;
6. Alignment and Automation – Policies and security success metrics must map directly to organizational mission and risk requirements and should favor automated execution and reporting.&#xD;
7. Security for the Full Lifecycle – Risk analysis and confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances must be sustained for the lifetime of the data, transaction, or relationship. Asset sensitivity must be reduced where possible (removing sensitive/regulated data, privileges, etc.), and assurances should be provided for the risk of data in use, in-flight, and at rest.&#xD;
Technology&#xD;
8. Asset-Centric Security – Security must be as close to the assets as possible (i.e., data-centric and application-centric approaches instead of network-centric strategies) to provide a tailored approach that minimizes productivity disruption.&#xD;
9. Least Privilege – Access to systems and data must be granted only as required and removed when no longer required.&#xD;
Security Controls&#xD;
10. Simple and Pervasive – Security mechanisms must be simple, scalable, and easy to implement and manage throughout the organizational ecosystem (whether internal or external).&#xD;
11. Explicit Trust Validation – Assumptions of integrity and trust level must be explicitly validated against organization risk threshold and tolerance. Assets and/or data systems must be validated before being allowed to interact with anyone/anything else.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Integration Context&#xD;
A data integration may be architected as part of a Solution or Capability Architecture development or as part of an Enterprise Architecture development. The TOGAF® Standard (see References) defines an Architecture Development Method (ADM), and its Enterprise Continuum provides an overall context for architectures and solutions, and classifies assets that apply across the entire scope of the enterprise.&#xD;
One of the key aspects of Enterprise Architecture implementation is data migration from the existing to the target environment. The target environment is generally rationalized and streamlined, entailing a major data integration effort to migrate the data.&#xD;
Most data integration architectures are in the organization-specific part of that continuum, guiding and supporting organization-specific data integration solutions. Portals, integrated information environments (An Information Architecture Vision: Moving from Data Rich to Information Smart; see References), information sharing environments, and emerging data fabric/data mesh concepts are common systems architecture concepts, and they guide and support the use of vendor and open source data platforms that are common systems solutions.&#xD;
A data integration is typically preceded by planning, discovery, and extraction, and followed by verification before the integrated data “goes live”. From that point, it is subject to lifecycle management, which determines its storage, use, and eventual disposal. These activities are all carried out in accordance with information governance, as illustrated in Figure 1:&#xD;
• Plan: includes representing information holdings and identifying shortfalls, such as a lack of requisite quality&#xD;
• Discover &amp; Extract: includes analyzing the shortfalls, finding sources and information quality (often through metadata), assessing privacy and legality of extraction, cost-benefit analysis, and getting the information required directly or indirectly (e.g., through data as a service)&#xD;
• Transform &amp; Integrate: includes transforming data into a standard enterprise format, assessing information loss and resultant quality, information sub-integration (e.g., multi-sensor), creating metadata for integrated data, and integration with existing information holdings&#xD;
• Verify: includes establishing the legal/privacy/policy framework, determining whether the integration is legal, determining whether the integration is in line with enterprise values and brand, and determining the need to transform (e.g., anonymize) integrated data&#xD;
• Use: includes operations, decision support, and analytics; for example, Business Intelligence (BI) and Machine Learning (ML)&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;Figure 1: Data Integration Context>&#xD;
&#xD;
In a complex case – for example, following a merger – there may be many data integrations carried out in parallel, and the integration may not be a “one-off” event, but a continuous process operating on data that is continually changing. This process may be partly or entirely automated. Establishing such processes can be a significant part of a Solution or Enterprise Architecture.&#xD;
The Technology Architecture phase of a TOGAF architecture development includes the identification of appropriate technical standards. The standards described in this document are candidates for inclusion in the Technology Architecture of an architecture development that covers data integration.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Fabric and Data Mesh&#xD;
A data fabric is an architected system that provides uniform access to data held in multiple, disparate sources. To do this, it uses data integration as the underlying implementation. A data mesh is an architected system which, like a data fabric, uses data integration implicitly, but which need not provide uniform access, and is based on data products. Relatively few enterprises have data fabrics or data meshes today, but their use is growing.</documentation>

      <documentation>Structure Standards&#xD;
According to the Encyclopedia of Computer Science (see References), a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. A data structure standard defines such a collection in general terms, so that it is possible to determine whether a particular collection of data values is an instance.&#xD;
(There are differing definitions of structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data, and the industry has not yet reached consensus on them. Arguably, any collection of data values has some structure. How non-trivial that structure must be for the collection to qualify as structured or semi-structured is for debate.)&#xD;
There are generic data structure standards that can apply to any application domain, and domain-specific data structure standards that define data structures appropriate to specific application domains.</documentation>

      <documentation>API Standards&#xD;
Web service APIs are interfaces for data transmission or exchange using the Web’s HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).4&#xD;
An API client can obtain data from an API or post data to an API. Analysis and transformation software can obtain source data and contextual metadata from APIs, can post integrated data to APIs, or can serve APIs from which integrated data is obtained.&#xD;
There were 22,000 APIs registered with the ProgrammableWeb™ API Directory5 in June 2019, with the number growing at 220 APIs per month. Many domain-specific data structure standards (including FHIR, OFX, and the Open Banking Standard) define data structures used in APIs.</documentation>

      <documentation>Metadata Standards&#xD;
Metadata is data that describes and gives information about other data. It can describe structured data or human-readable content.&#xD;
The Data Management Body of Knowledge (DMBOK®) (see References), defines metadata as “data used to manage and use data”, and says that it “describes what data an organization has, how it is classified, where it came from, how it moves within the organization, how it evolves through use, who can and cannot use it, and whether it is of high quality”.&#xD;
Metadata is often used to describe the semantics of data. Semantics can be defined as the meaning or relationship of meanings of a sign or set of signs (Merriam-Webster Dictionary; see References). In the context of data, this is the meaning or relationship of meanings of a data value or collection of data values. Data semantics standards generally assume some kind of data structure.&#xD;
Metadata can also be used to hold information that supports data management and integration processes, such as data synchronization, governance, quality control, defense, and security. For example, creation/modification time information can support data synchronization.&#xD;
Metadata may be provided by a data storage system such as those shown in Table 9.&#xD;

      <documentation>Data Analysis and Transformation Standards&#xD;
Data analysis22 is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.&#xD;
Data transformation23 is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure. Generally, it does so while preserving the semantics of the data.&#xD;
“Datafication” is a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into data (Cukier; see References). This often includes the transformation of unstructured and semi-structured data into structured data. Examples include natural language processing, computer vision, and signal (e.g., satellite imagery) processing.&#xD;
There are standards that apply to data analysis and transformation professionals and processes, and there are standards for software data analysis and transformation programs.</documentation>

      <documentation>1.2.7.	Drivers for Change&#xD;
In the first year after its creation, the CDO consulted broadly within ESDC and examined industry trends and challenges faced across Government of Canada (GC).  Numerous challenges were identified by multiple stakeholders, and the following themes emerged:&#xD;
•	The collection, storage and analysis of data is widely dispersed across multiple branches, program areas and regions within the department.  This has many consequences:&#xD;
o	Employees face barriers to accessing information they need to perform analysis that will benefit Canadians and the department&#xD;
o	Privacy controls and transparency of use of data for citizens is inconsistent across data holding and business lines&#xD;
o	Data from different program areas cannot be linked to accurately and efficiently support necessary, authorized policy insights requested by government&#xD;
o	Performance reporting, forecasting and workload management are limited and inconsistent across programs.  There are inadequate performance measures that focus on outcomes.&#xD;
•	Program and project authorities take a tactical “program/project first, enterprise second” view toward data priorities resulting in little or no advancement toward strategic enterprise outcomes.&#xD;
•	Enterprise infrastructure to support advanced and emerging data analytics, for example modern data visualization practices, forecasting, machine learning and artificial intelligence does not exist at the enterprise level and cannot be consistently or effectively implemented in small program/project silos.&#xD;
•	ESDC has a very large investment portfolio with Statistics Canada that is scattered among many divisions and branches.  Data collected from surveys, research and partners is difficult to integrate with program data to derive insights into how the program is responding to intended outcomes, or unintended consequences.&#xD;
•	In some areas where data is accessible and usable, low data literacy is limiting data value.&#xD;
•	Executives, accustomed to managing human and financial resources, lack the understanding, tools and skills needed to manage data as a resource with comparable skill.&#xD;
•	To get work done, employees often extract data from secure systems into network assets such as Excel work sheets to manipulate data.  Executives often do not have clear line of sight into who has access to what data, and for what purpose.  &#xD;
&#xD;
As a result of these and other challenges, ESDC is facing missed opportunities to generate strategic insights, to pursue opportunities, to reduce risks and to realize greater efficiencies.  The department is also challenged to advance its commitment to open up more of its data holdings to the public and Canada’s research community.&#xD;
Resources are limited and must be invested with probity and efficiency.  ESDC must maximize opportunities and investments in data while reducing the burden on its own resources and on Canadian taxpayers.</documentation>

      <documentation>1.4.1.	Research, Vision &amp; Strategy &#xD;
The first step in any business is “know thy customer”.  For ESDC, this entails collecting information through partners, research and surveys to understand our clients: people and businesses.  This information, describing client needs and the operating environment of the business, needs to be integrated with departmental data holdings.  This will enable us to serve our clients, but also to meet the needs of our own executive and our partners.  This critical first step, understanding both business challenges and challenges in domains such as data, policy, technology, etc., forms the first part of foundations: Research, Vision and Strategy comprising five activities:&#xD;
•	Demographic Data Intake Partnerships   Establish the capability to obtain on a continuous basis partner available data that describes the ever-changing operational environment of the business, particularly the client base and their needs.&#xD;
•	Surveys and Research  Identify gaps in available data that describes the operational environment of the business, and act proactively to fill those gaps.&#xD;
•	Data Strategy  Define the path and provisions needed to progress the business management of data as an asset.&#xD;
•	Data Policy  Support the strategy with overarching policy that provides guidance to ensure that organization acts in a manner that is consistent with successful implementation of the strategy.&#xD;
•	Data Governance  Define the roles and procedures that assure the effective management of data, i.e. to ensure that as a critical resource, data is available as needed to support the business and safeguarded to ensure its availability, confidentiality and integrity.  &#xD;

      <documentation>Guiding principles (GC Strategic Plan For IM&amp;IT 2017-21)&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 1: client and service-centred design&#xD;
GC solutions and services are designed from a client-centred and end-to-end digital service delivery perspective to increase the value they bring to clients through:&#xD;
early user engagement&#xD;
convenient access and availability through multiple channels&#xD;
pre-population of information when possible and where appropriate&#xD;
simplified, streamlined and joined-up workflows&#xD;
reuse of information where appropriate&#xD;
rigorous user testing&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 2: open&#xD;
GC information and data is open by default, ensuring that:&#xD;
information and data are made open to the public to the greatest extent possible&#xD;
new processes are designed to enable and facilitate proactive release of government data and information by default&#xD;
the public actively participates in policy, program and service design&#xD;
citizens are consulted and engaged in government decisions and operations&#xD;
GC employees work “in the open”&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 3: enterprise first&#xD;
Departments will follow common standards, approaches and direction, and use existing enterprise assets, such as processes, data, contracts and solutions, as accelerators where:&#xD;
information is created once, reused numerous times, and managed GC-wide as a single-aligned asset that is consistent, standardized and interoperable&#xD;
solutions support the use of open standards, are scalable and can be rapidly deployed&#xD;
cost-effective and efficient business solutions facilitate information and data integration, reuse, management, sharing and analytics&#xD;
common business needs are addressed through enterprise or shared solutions, and departments stop investing in departmental legacy systems and refocus efforts, resources and funds on becoming ready to adopt an enterprise or shared solution and on accelerating its implementation&#xD;
efforts across the GC are more coherent, integrated, secure and effective&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 4: secure&#xD;
GC information is safeguarded for security, privacy and confidentiality, is monitored to prevent leaks, and is protected for future generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 5: cloud first approach&#xD;
Departments will explore “… as a service” (XaaS) cloud services before developing solutions in-house. This includes private and public cloud offerings.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 6: enable a modern workplace: anywhere, anytime with anyone&#xD;
The GC strives to be an innovative organization that:&#xD;
provides its employees with modern technology that supports information retrieval, use, sharing and collaboration by making information and data accessible when and where needed&#xD;
provides customizable tools and resources with minimized learning requirements for users&#xD;
provides automated, digital processes in support of better services&#xD;
attracts, retains and encourages public servants to work smarter and be innovative, greener and healthier so that they better serve Canadians&#xD;
&#xD;
Early thinking on new digital principles is in progress in support of the shift to digital (see Appendix F).</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Grouping" name="Strategic Actions: Information and Data Sharing" id="id-ccd1d3719f1c4c73aee0f9fd934256f1">
      <documentation>Information and data sharing&#xD;
Interoperable platforms are the backbone of data and information sharing, big data analytics and collaboration. By seizing on these opportunities, government can create a modern workplace in which employees have the enabling tools needed to keep pace with the expectations of the Canadians and businesses they serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
Determine the feasibility of developing a “tell us once” approach for government (planned actions)&#xD;
TBS will investigate the “tell us once” approach for the GC from various perspectives to understand possible risks and challenges including: security, privacy, IM and IT.&#xD;
&#xD;
Build a platform for enterprise interoperability (actions underway)&#xD;
TBS will continue to work with stakeholders to develop a unified service approach and to create a set of modern integration tools called the GC Interoperability Platform (GCIP). This platform acts as an information broker, enabling the exchange of data and information between enterprise systems, departments and governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
The GCIP project will implement a central data exchange where information can be shared securely and reliably between government applications. Three core solutions for financial management, human resource management and information management will be connected to seamlessly exchange information, regardless of the technologies underpinning them. These systems operate on a “tell us once” principle, where data is entered in one system and then reused by multiple other systems, as legislation and policy permit, thus reducing the need for duplicate data entry while improving data integrity and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
This work will lay the foundation to link internal departmental information with solutions for delivering programs and services and enable greater GC-wide collaboration when designing digital services.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS will continue to lead the adoption of a common GCIP to support information sharing inside and outside the GC domain. This approach will enable business process improvement within the government and across jurisdictions, leading to improved program and service delivery for citizens and businesses.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Through the creation and use of a governance framework (policies, directives, guidelines and open standards) for the GCIP, TBS will:&#xD;
&#xD;
foster openness and collaboration&#xD;
promote digital services&#xD;
advance enterprise interoperability and information sharing across the government&#xD;
Introduce a strategy for use of open source software and open standards (planned actions)&#xD;
The use of open source software supports interoperability and information sharing and should be considered in the assessment of IM-IT solutions. Open source products are publicly available, and the availability of their source code promotes open and collaborative development around their specifications, making them more robust and interoperable. The use of open standards ensures interoperability between products and systems, and maintains flexibility within the IM-IT environment. TBS will lead the development of a strategy to set direction for the government on the use and release of open source software and open standards that will be ratified by GC EARB.&#xD;
&#xD;
Introduce a mobile application strategy and framework (planned actions)&#xD;
Canadians and business want to use mobile applications to interact with government data and obtain government services. As part of the overall web strategy, TBS will lead the development of a strategy and framework for the development and management of mobile applications that are easy to use and trusted that will be validated through GC EARB. GC mobile applications will be identified on Canada.ca and available through application stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
Develop an application programming interface strategy (actions underway)&#xD;
APIs are used to reveal GC digital capabilities and can be combined and reused to create digital services. APIs are increasingly becoming the way to facilitate sharing of government data and information and, as such, are foundational building blocks that support the GC’s commitment to digital services. TBS will develop an API strategy for the GC.&#xD;
&#xD;
Introduce a government API store (actions underway)&#xD;
TBS will lead the creation of an API store to support information sharing with Canadians, business and other entities external to government. Departments have already made available a number of APIs. The GC API store will offer a consistent means to discovering APIs and subscribing to them. The store will provide API publishers and users with a central, multi-tenant API management platform that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
a searchable catalogue&#xD;
version control&#xD;
automated access provisioning workflows&#xD;
Operating under a self-service model, API publishers will be allowed to sign up and benefit from “active documentation” that allows them to drill into API definitions, try APIs and share their feedback in the store’s forum.&#xD;
&#xD;
Interoperability, mobile applications and APIs are key elements to supporting digital services for the GC.&#xD;
&#xD;
Enhance online infrastructure to enable departments to release their data and information (actions underway)&#xD;
Having reliable infrastructure in place to ensure the maximum release of government data and information ultimately results in:&#xD;
&#xD;
a platform for Canadians that enables access to open government data and information&#xD;
the opportunity to meaningfully engage on related issues&#xD;
The long-term goals of these activities are to deliver value to Canadians through open information and data that:&#xD;
&#xD;
fosters greater citizen participation in government&#xD;
promotes innovation&#xD;
creates economic opportunities&#xD;
Canada’s Open Data Exchange (ODX) is an organization that helps Canadian companies make use of open data. TBS will work with the ODX to deepen insight into the commercial open data landscape and to understand what challenges need to be overcome in order to make Canadian open data companies more competitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
Develop a master data management program (planned actions)&#xD;
In an open and distributed operational environment such as the GC, there is a risk that business-critical data becomes redundant, inconsistent and scattered throughout the enterprise.&#xD;
&#xD;
Master data management (MDM) can be defined as the processes, governance, tools, rules and technology required to create and maintain consistent and accurate master data. It focuses on common critical data elements and establishes strong governance around them. MDM can eliminate redundancy and inconsistency of data in an organization and ensure its quality and control. It can provide a single, authoritative point of reference that can be shared by many processes and applications across the organization. It can also streamline data sharing and facilitate interoperability.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS will work with key business owners (for example, the Office of the Comptroller General and the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer) to establish a government-wide MDM program to formally identify standard data elements and single authoritative sources for key information domains, where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
Advance analytics (planned actions)&#xD;
Business intelligence involves creating, aggregating, analyzing and visualizing data to inform and facilitate business management and strategy. Analytics is about asking questions and refers to all the ways in which data can be broken down, compared and examined for trends. Big data is the technology that stores and processes data and information in datasets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications can’t analyze them. Big data can make available almost limitless amounts of information, improving data-driven decision making and expanding open data initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS, working with departments, will lead the development of requirements for an enterprise analytics platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS will work with departments to identify a business lead to develop a data lake (a repository of raw data) service strategy so that the GC can take advantage of big data and market innovation to foster better analytics and promote horizontal data sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implement a platform for external collaboration (actions underway)&#xD;
Technology makes it easier for citizens, academia, scientists, businesses and government to share ideas and information and to collaborate with one another. TBS will lead the establishment of an external collaboration service provider to host departments and provide them with a dedicated workspace and computing storage for unclassified and transitory data. Cloud pilot projects will test-drive requirements and determine the most suitable platform to meet government business, information and security needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS, in collaboration with departments, including PSPC and SSC, provides departments with a secure platform called GCCollab to:&#xD;
&#xD;
share opinions, information and analyses&#xD;
collaborate with external partners, academia, businesses, other governments and citizens&#xD;
While meeting the government’s requirements for security classification, disposition and recordkeeping, the platform will support an array of functions such as document sharing, co-authoring, assigning tasks, organizing meetings and holding discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implement GCDOCS (actions underway)&#xD;
Time and productivity are frequently lost due to the lack of consistent tools and systems to help employees store, search and find the information and data they need to do their jobs. Enterprise IM solutions such as GCDOCS streamline and simplify these processes, but they need to be configured properly to make back-end IM processes as invisible as possible to users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Automation can provide opportunities to:&#xD;
&#xD;
simplify and streamline key IM processes and practices&#xD;
deliver a seamless user experience that relieves burden on individual GC workers&#xD;
Furthermore, implementing integrated and standardized solutions across departments can help make it easier for GC employees to find, use and share the information and data they need to do their job, while ensuring consistent, foundational management of GC information assets. Information and data can be leveraged to help departments achieve their business objectives and meet their mandated requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
TBS and PSPC will enhance the government-wide GCDOCS service for departments, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
full deployment by 2022&#xD;
broadening its integration with back office systems&#xD;
piloting its use as a tool for increasing the openness of government information&#xD;
Migrate websites to Canada.ca and assess options for a single GC digital service platform (actions underway)&#xD;
The GC’s Web Renewal Initiative will improve Canadians’ access to GC online services through a single online window (Canada.ca). This initiative will bring hundreds of existing sites into one, designed to better meet the needs of Canadians. TBS will develop a new strategy to set further direction on providing a single window to Canadians for all GC information and services and create the conditions required to transition to a single GC service platform.</documentation>

        <documentation>2.3.1.1 Entities&#xD;
An entity is a thing with a distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization, or device that can be subject to legislation, policy, or regulations within a&#xD;
context, and which may have certain rights, duties, and obligations. An entity can perform one or more roles in the digital ecosystem. There are two types of entities: atomic entities and compound entities. An atomic entity is an entity that cannot be decomposed into smaller units. Persons are atomic entities. A compound entity is an entity that is comprised of one or more atomic entities. Organizations are compound entities. </documentation>

        <documentation>Introduction: Where We Stand&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture (EA) Strategy and accompanying Roadmap detail the multi-year plan to evolve EA within Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). This evolution will ensure that the EA program has the capabilities, capacities, and competencies needed to help ESDC towards its goal of becoming an integral part of a digital government.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;We need to be cautious about our tactical approach: Success can kill innovation. We need to re-assess our level of maturity, and try to fill in any gaps that we might have forgotten about.” - Jean B. Lapierre (Enterprise Architect, Solution Architecture Services)&#xD;
&#xD;
The EA Strategy and Roadmap represent a collaborative effort among all the architecture domains, and consultation with key stakeholders, to mature, given the Government of Canada’s Directive on Service and Digital and ESDC’s Transformation Agenda. The evolution of EA and corresponding paradigm shift to Lean and Agile methodologies will happen across three horizons over the next seven years.&#xD;
&#xD;
The development and execution of the EA Strategy and Roadmap began at the end of the 2019-2020 fiscal year and continues to date, not withstanding the challenges of COVID-19. In fact, in the spring of 2020, coordinators of the Strategy and Roadmap adjusted them in response to the pandemic. This resulted in a new focus of the first phase of the Roadmap, being those activities central to either enhancing and expanding EA capacities, or innovating and driving EA’s Lean and Agile paradigm shift.</documentation>

        <documentation>SharePoint Permission Levels&#xD;
The first step to managing permissions in SharePoint is to understand what actions the various permission levels authorize a person to perform. As a DesignerPlus, you will be granting the Read, Contribute and Design permission levels to people using your SharePoint site – the rest of the permission levels are described for your information only. &#xD;
&#xD;
SharePoint Permission Level - Description&#xD;
 - Read - Read-only access to the site. Users with this permission level can view items, web pages and documents, but they cannot delete content or make any changes.&#xD;
 - Contribute - Read-Write access to the site. Users with this permission level can view, upload, delete and make changes to items, web pages and documents.&#xD;
 - Design - Designers can do everything that Contributors can do, plus they have the ability to create lists, libraries, views and metadata columns. &#xD;
 - DesignerPlus - A DesignerPlus can do everything a Designer can do, plus they have the ability to manage and customize permissions to control content access.&#xD;
 - Full Control - DO NOT GRANT Full Control permissions. This permission level is only used by departmental SharePoint site administration and support.&#xD;
 - Limited Access - You can effectively IGNORE Limited Access permissions. Limited Access simply indicates that the person or group has a different level of access assigned somewhere else in the site using customized permissions (see Section 4).&#xD;
 - View Web Analytics Data - This permission level grants people the ability to see the Site Collection Web Analytics Reports found in the ‘Site Settings’ menu. It does not grant access to specific content such as items, web pages or documents.&#xD;

        <documentation>SharePoint Permission Levels&#xD;
The first step to managing permissions in SharePoint is to understand what actions the various permission levels authorize a person to perform. As a DesignerPlus, you will be granting the Read, Contribute and Design permission levels to people using your SharePoint site – the rest of the permission levels are described for your information only. &#xD;
&#xD;
SharePoint Permission Level - Description&#xD;
 - Read - Read-only access to the site. Users with this permission level can view items, web pages and documents, but they cannot delete content or make any changes.&#xD;
 - Contribute - Read-Write access to the site. Users with this permission level can view, upload, delete and make changes to items, web pages and documents.&#xD;
 - Design - Designers can do everything that Contributors can do, plus they have the ability to create lists, libraries, views and metadata columns. &#xD;
 - DesignerPlus - A DesignerPlus can do everything a Designer can do, plus they have the ability to manage and customize permissions to control content access.&#xD;
 - Full Control - DO NOT GRANT Full Control permissions. This permission level is only used by departmental SharePoint site administration and support.&#xD;
 - Limited Access - You can effectively IGNORE Limited Access permissions. Limited Access simply indicates that the person or group has a different level of access assigned somewhere else in the site using customized permissions (see Section 4).&#xD;
 - View Web Analytics Data - This permission level grants people the ability to see the Site Collection Web Analytics Reports found in the ‘Site Settings’ menu. It does not grant access to specific content such as items, web pages or documents.&#xD;

DETAILS&#xD;
This document identifies and briefly describes the technical standards relevant to structured data integration, and discusses some wider non-technical considerations. It covers de facto best practice standards, standards from industry consortia, and standards from formal standards bodies. It is intended for Technical Architects and Data Architects.&#xD;
&#xD;
By listing relevant standards, this document provides a useful body of reference. It helps Enterprise Architects to achieve Boundaryless Information Flow™ by improving data integration in their enterprises. It also provides a basis for future work from The Open Group to identify and describe data integration best practices.&#xD;

        <documentation>The Workload Migration (WLM) and Cloud Enablement project is seeking to address the migration of the majority of ESDCs applications that are currently hosted in legacy Shared Services Canada (SSC) data centres to Enterprise Data Centres or to Cloud, per the Government of Canada’s strategy to consolidate data centres across the Government of Canada (GC).&#xD;
The existing legacy data centres no longer meet SSC standards that are now in place in Enterprise Data Centres, creating a risk to several aspects of these applications such as their infrastructure, operational risks, IT security, and network related risks. Applications hosted in legacy data centres may also be limited in implementing future business needs.&#xD;
The applications currently hosted in legacy data centres will undergo thorough assessment while following the GC guidelines of Cloud First and TIME (tolerate, invest, move, eliminate) to determine their end-state hosting environments (Enterprise Data Centres or Cloud). The WLM project has several goals, the first of which is to serve as a risk response to the risks that have been identified should the movement of these applications not occur. Another goal of the WLM project is to improve the ESDC Security Posture and IT Service Delivery by moving applications to hosting environments that maintain a higher standard of security and compliance than in existing legacy data centres.&#xD;
Lastly, the WLM project seeks to help in the reduction of technical debt and in the modernization of applications, consistent with the departmental transformation agenda.&#xD;
This document seeks to recommend the adoption of the implementation of TIME assessment recommendations, at an approximate cost of $M over XX years. The realization of benefits that will occur as a result of this option include the improvement of IT security posture and compliance, the improvement of productivity, the reduction of risk exposure and versatility in application development. The options analysis described in this document has concluded that remaining with the status quo is not a feasible option, and that the option of a lift and shift will provide only part of the benefits, yet increase the departmental technical debt in coming years.&#xD;
The WLM Project has many risks listed throughout this business case. The number of applications in scope, their complexity and interdependencies are key considerations. ESDC’s expertise in Cloud technology and the differences between the targeted architectures (Cloud and Enterprise Data Centres) and current legacy data centres, as well as the Network complexity, are other important considerations.&#xD;
SSC and ESDC have identified mitigation measures that will be implemented. These measures, paired with a strong governance and continuous risk monitoring, will bring the risks described below to an acceptable level.&#xD;
&#xD;
2.1 Problem/Opportunity&#xD;
The majority of ESDC systems are currently hosted in legacy Shared Services Canada (SSC) data centre facilities with aging infrastructure. These centres have not been designated as Enterprise Data Centres (thereby limiting further investment). The data centres are not designed to support 24/7 operations with 99.99% uptime and therefore are subject to outages and rely on older technologies to operate. This introduces infrastructure, operational, IT security, and network risks while greatly limiting the type of solutions that can be housed in these data centres to meet new business requirements. As part of the Government of Canada(GC) strategy to consolidate GC data centres and implement Cloud First, ESDC is initiating an assessment of 385 applications hosted within the Moncton and Montréal legacy data centres. This assessment will identify the appropriate disposition of each application as per the GC guidelines (i.e. Tolerate (maintain), Invest, Move, or Eliminate) and based on ESDC medium and longerterm business requirements. ESDC will develop a roadmap based on this assessment to address risks and known technical debt, in concert with the transformation agenda currently underway at ESDC. This involves migrating departmental applications from existing SSC legacy data centres into new hosting environments. ESDC will work with Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) and SSC to identify target hosting environments, including Cloud based hosting services operated by the Government of Canada and private industry and at new, state-of-the-art data centres operated by SSC.</documentation>

        <documentation>Executive Summary&#xD;
Following the 2023 budget proposal to implement the new Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP) to provide dental coverage for uninsured Canadians, the CDCP will:&#xD;
· provide Canadians the ability to apply and be considered access to the CDCP for their oral heath needs,&#xD;
· seek help and guidance on eligibility, how to apply and information on the program, and&#xD;
· maintain or renew their status throughout the year.&#xD;
This business case details the CDCP business need, business context, background, options analysis, evaluation criteria, and solution scope to deliver the solution project.&#xD;
&#xD;
Business Context Diagram Description&#xD;
Budget 2023 proposes providing $13 billion over five years, starting in 2023-24, and $4.4 billion ongoing, to Health Canada (HC) to implement the new Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP). The CDCP will provide dental coverage for uninsured Canadians with an annual family income of less than $90,000, with no co-pays for those with family incomes under $70,000. &#xD;
It is estimated that approximately 9 million Canadians will be eligible for the CDCP. (Family income &lt;$90k, resident of Canada, no access to a comparable dental insurance plan). The CDCP will be an insurance program delivered via a third-party benefits administrator (TPA). The CDCP will be launched in phases, starting with a targeted eligible population of seniors, people with disabilities, and people under 18 (totaling 4.7M) in 2024. Seniors and persons with disabilities should be prioritized for coverage as of April 1, 2024. In addition, children under 12* must be enrolled and be able to access dental coverage under the Canada Dental Care Plan as of July 1, 2024. (given that the existing interim dental benefit for children under 12 ends July 1, 2024). Full program eligibility for all families within an income less than $90,000 and who do not have access dental care through an employer, pension or private plan will start January 2025. &#xD;
&#xD;
ESDC/Service Canada (SC) is entering in a partnership agreement to deliver services on behalf of HC to Canadians as the plan starts up and on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
HC is the lead for program implementation and works in collaboration with ESDC/Service Canada and partners on this implementation. This business case encompasses the CDCP service delivery implementation project that will deliver the required capabilities to intake CDCP applications, process applications and determine eligibility, communicate the decision to applicants and provide client support in the Service Canada network. The capabilities will support delivery of the following target client experience and flow: &lt;May 4, 2023 Service Delivery Process Flow Diagram (A-to-H)></documentation>

      <documentation>HONOURABLE SENATORS, MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,&#xD;
Every day on our shared planet, millions face hardships that test the human spirit. Extreme weather, wildfires, poverty, conflicts, discrimination and inequalities. Rarely though, has all of humanity faced a single common insidious enemy. An invisible enemy that respects no borders, thrives anywhere, hits anyone.&#xD;
To overcome a pandemic requires the work and resolve of every order of government, every community, and every one of us. &#xD;
We don’t decide when hardship comes, but here in Canada, we have decided how we wanted to address it. We have adapted in remarkable ways.&#xD;
We Canadians did our part. We changed our habits, postponed our plans, switched to teleworking or had to completely reinvent our work, all this, while caring for one another.&#xD;
We owe an immense debt to those who served and still serve on the frontlines, to health care personnel and essential workers, women and men in uniform, volunteers and leaders, everywhere in the country.&#xD;
There has been a lot of suffering and we all mourn those who have passed.&#xD;
We trust science to lead the fight until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available. But until then, we must keep our guard up, using the tools that are available to us now – such as testing, treatments and physical distancing measures.&#xD;
Like a reed in high winds, we might sway but we will not break. Because our roots are firmly in place, our goals clear, and because we have hope – the hope that lifts the soul on dark days and keeps us focused on the future.&#xD;
Canadians have lived through uncertain times before and have always prevailed because determination, concern for others, courage, and common sense define our nation.&#xD;
We must bring all those qualities to bear once again and continue to work for the common good, and for a better, safer and more just society.&#xD;
This is who we are and what will see us through to brighter days.&#xD;
&#xD;
OPENING&#xD;
For over 150 years, Parliamentarians have worked together to chart Canada’s path forward.&#xD;
Your predecessors met when Confederation was only a few months old, setting the course for a young country. They stood united through Canada’s toughest days, leading the nation through wars and depression. And as they did, each Parliamentarian was called to meet their times.&#xD;
Today, Canadians expect you to do the same. They expect you to work together on their behalf and meet this crucial moment.&#xD;
Less than a year ago, we gathered here for a Throne Speech to open the 43rd Parliament. Since then, our realities have changed. And so must our approach.&#xD;
This pandemic is the most serious public health crisis Canada has ever faced.&#xD;
Over 9,000 Canadians have died in six months. For our neighbours in the United States, this figure is over 200,000. Globally, it’s nearly a million.&#xD;
But these aren’t just numbers. These are friends and family. Neighbours and colleagues.&#xD;
The pandemic is the story of parents who have died alone, without loved ones to hold their hand.&#xD;
It is the story of kids who have gone months without seeing friends.&#xD;
Of workers who have lost their jobs.&#xD;
The last six months have laid bare fundamental gaps in our society, and in societies around the world. This pandemic has been hard for everyone. But for those who were already struggling, the burden has been even heavier.&#xD;
For parents – and especially moms – who are facing impossible choices between kids and career.&#xD;
For racialized Canadians and Indigenous Peoples who are confronted by systemic barriers.&#xD;
For young people who are worried about what their future will hold.&#xD;
For seniors who are isolated, frightened, and most at risk.&#xD;
And for workers who, while earning the lowest wages in the most precarious sectors, have been on the frontlines of the pandemic.&#xD;
We must address these challenges of today. But we also cannot forget about the tests of the future.&#xD;
The world came into this pandemic facing the risks and consequences of climate change. A lesson that COVID-19 has taught us, is that we need to match challenges with decisiveness and determination.&#xD;
On all of these fronts – health and the economy, equality and the environment – we must take bold action.&#xD;
The Government will meet these challenges.&#xD;
The Government’s approach will have four foundations.&#xD;
The first foundation of this plan is to fight the pandemic and save lives.&#xD;
The second foundation of the Government’s plan is supporting people and businesses through this crisis as long as it lasts, whatever it takes. Effectively dealing with the health crisis is the best thing we can do for the economy. Government action has already helped Canadians stay safe, and buffered the worst economic impacts.&#xD;
The third foundation is to build back better to create a stronger, more resilient Canada. To do this, we must keep strengthening the middle class and helping people working hard to join it, and continue creating jobs and building long-term competitiveness with clean growth. We must also keep building safer communities for everyone.&#xD;
The fourth and final foundation of this plan is to stand up for who we are as Canadians. We cannot forget what has made us a country that is welcoming. A country that celebrates two official languages. That achieves progress on gender equality, walks the road of reconciliation, and fights discrimination of every kind.&#xD;
This is our generation’s crossroads.&#xD;
Do we move Canada forward, or let people be left behind? Do we come out of this stronger, or paper over the cracks that the crisis has exposed?&#xD;
This is the time to remember who we are as Canadians.&#xD;
This is the opportunity to contain the global crisis and build back better, together.&#xD;
&#xD;
CONCLUSION&#xD;
Taken together, this is an ambitious plan for an unprecedented reality.&#xD;
The course of events will determine what needs to be done when. But throughout, protecting and supporting Canadians will stay the top priority.&#xD;
And the core values that have driven the Government since day one remain the same.&#xD;
In 2015, Canadians asked their government to deliver real change on everything from middle class jobs to climate change. In 2019, the people chose a Parliament that would keep moving forward on these shared goals. And in 2020, Canadians expect nothing less.&#xD;
It is no small task to build a stronger, more resilient country.&#xD;
It will take hard work. It will require a commitment to finding common ground.&#xD;
Parliamentarians, Canadians have placed a trust in you to guide this country forward. They have placed their faith in you to work together to meet whatever challenges we face.&#xD;
Remember that we are here today because of the generations of Canadians who came before us. We are here because of the women and men – our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents – who had the courage to reach for a better future.&#xD;
Today, it is our turn. Our moment to build a stronger and more resilient Canada for everyone.&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament. &#xD;
Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons, may you be equal to the profound trust bestowed on you by Canadians, and may Divine Providence guide you in all your duties.</documentation>

      <documentation>HONOURABLE SENATORS, MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,&#xD;
Every day on our shared planet, millions face hardships that test the human spirit. Extreme weather, wildfires, poverty, conflicts, discrimination and inequalities. Rarely though, has all of humanity faced a single common insidious enemy. An invisible enemy that respects no borders, thrives anywhere, hits anyone.&#xD;
To overcome a pandemic requires the work and resolve of every order of government, every community, and every one of us. &#xD;
We don’t decide when hardship comes, but here in Canada, we have decided how we wanted to address it. We have adapted in remarkable ways.&#xD;
We Canadians did our part. We changed our habits, postponed our plans, switched to teleworking or had to completely reinvent our work, all this, while caring for one another.&#xD;
We owe an immense debt to those who served and still serve on the frontlines, to health care personnel and essential workers, women and men in uniform, volunteers and leaders, everywhere in the country.&#xD;
There has been a lot of suffering and we all mourn those who have passed.&#xD;
We trust science to lead the fight until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available. But until then, we must keep our guard up, using the tools that are available to us now – such as testing, treatments and physical distancing measures.&#xD;
Like a reed in high winds, we might sway but we will not break. Because our roots are firmly in place, our goals clear, and because we have hope – the hope that lifts the soul on dark days and keeps us focused on the future.&#xD;
Canadians have lived through uncertain times before and have always prevailed because determination, concern for others, courage, and common sense define our nation.&#xD;
We must bring all those qualities to bear once again and continue to work for the common good, and for a better, safer and more just society.&#xD;
This is who we are and what will see us through to brighter days.&#xD;
&#xD;
OPENING&#xD;
For over 150 years, Parliamentarians have worked together to chart Canada’s path forward.&#xD;
Your predecessors met when Confederation was only a few months old, setting the course for a young country. They stood united through Canada’s toughest days, leading the nation through wars and depression. And as they did, each Parliamentarian was called to meet their times.&#xD;
Today, Canadians expect you to do the same. They expect you to work together on their behalf and meet this crucial moment.&#xD;
Less than a year ago, we gathered here for a Throne Speech to open the 43rd Parliament. Since then, our realities have changed. And so must our approach.&#xD;
This pandemic is the most serious public health crisis Canada has ever faced.&#xD;
Over 9,000 Canadians have died in six months. For our neighbours in the United States, this figure is over 200,000. Globally, it’s nearly a million.&#xD;
But these aren’t just numbers. These are friends and family. Neighbours and colleagues.&#xD;
The pandemic is the story of parents who have died alone, without loved ones to hold their hand.&#xD;
It is the story of kids who have gone months without seeing friends.&#xD;
Of workers who have lost their jobs.&#xD;
The last six months have laid bare fundamental gaps in our society, and in societies around the world. This pandemic has been hard for everyone. But for those who were already struggling, the burden has been even heavier.&#xD;
For parents – and especially moms – who are facing impossible choices between kids and career.&#xD;
For racialized Canadians and Indigenous Peoples who are confronted by systemic barriers.&#xD;
For young people who are worried about what their future will hold.&#xD;
For seniors who are isolated, frightened, and most at risk.&#xD;
And for workers who, while earning the lowest wages in the most precarious sectors, have been on the frontlines of the pandemic.&#xD;
We must address these challenges of today. But we also cannot forget about the tests of the future.&#xD;
The world came into this pandemic facing the risks and consequences of climate change. A lesson that COVID-19 has taught us, is that we need to match challenges with decisiveness and determination.&#xD;
On all of these fronts – health and the economy, equality and the environment – we must take bold action.&#xD;
The Government will meet these challenges.&#xD;
The Government’s approach will have four foundations.&#xD;
The first foundation of this plan is to fight the pandemic and save lives.&#xD;
The second foundation of the Government’s plan is supporting people and businesses through this crisis as long as it lasts, whatever it takes. Effectively dealing with the health crisis is the best thing we can do for the economy. Government action has already helped Canadians stay safe, and buffered the worst economic impacts.&#xD;
The third foundation is to build back better to create a stronger, more resilient Canada. To do this, we must keep strengthening the middle class and helping people working hard to join it, and continue creating jobs and building long-term competitiveness with clean growth. We must also keep building safer communities for everyone.&#xD;
The fourth and final foundation of this plan is to stand up for who we are as Canadians. We cannot forget what has made us a country that is welcoming. A country that celebrates two official languages. That achieves progress on gender equality, walks the road of reconciliation, and fights discrimination of every kind.&#xD;
This is our generation’s crossroads.&#xD;
Do we move Canada forward, or let people be left behind? Do we come out of this stronger, or paper over the cracks that the crisis has exposed?&#xD;
This is the time to remember who we are as Canadians.&#xD;
This is the opportunity to contain the global crisis and build back better, together.&#xD;
&#xD;
CONCLUSION&#xD;
Taken together, this is an ambitious plan for an unprecedented reality.&#xD;
The course of events will determine what needs to be done when. But throughout, protecting and supporting Canadians will stay the top priority.&#xD;
And the core values that have driven the Government since day one remain the same.&#xD;
In 2015, Canadians asked their government to deliver real change on everything from middle class jobs to climate change. In 2019, the people chose a Parliament that would keep moving forward on these shared goals. And in 2020, Canadians expect nothing less.&#xD;
It is no small task to build a stronger, more resilient country.&#xD;
It will take hard work. It will require a commitment to finding common ground.&#xD;
Parliamentarians, Canadians have placed a trust in you to guide this country forward. They have placed their faith in you to work together to meet whatever challenges we face.&#xD;
Remember that we are here today because of the generations of Canadians who came before us. We are here because of the women and men – our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents – who had the courage to reach for a better future.&#xD;
Today, it is our turn. Our moment to build a stronger and more resilient Canada for everyone.&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament. &#xD;
Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons, may you be equal to the profound trust bestowed on you by Canadians, and may Divine Providence guide you in all your duties.</documentation>

        <content>MICM2 - Enforcement Business Case v12</content>
        <property key="MICM2 Business Case Statement" value="Every part of the continuum contributes to guiding client behavior.  The final and strongest tool available to ISB, and the element addressed in this business case, is the use of enforcement powers to pursue fraud, whether small or large, including recidivists and some of the most egregious offenders.  During any fiscal year, ISB will conduct between 100 and 500 enforcement investigations. Enforcement investigations are seeking to establish evidence of “guilty mind” by the subject, compared to compliance investigations that are seeking to establish and adjudicate on the conduct of “guilt acts” by the subject. As part of processing an enforcement case, there is involvement with the judiciary, so obtaining evidence requires more diligence and effort to conduct and holds more risk to the organization should they be conducted inappropriately."/>

It is not a standard as such, but is, instead, a framework that relates and applies existing standards, policies, guidelines, and practices, and where such standards and policies do not exist, specifies additional criteria.</documentation>

*Document Purpose And What's New*&#xD;
The Government of Canada (GC) Digital Operations Strategic Plan (DOSP) for 2021–2024 fulfills the responsibility of the Chief Information Officer of Canada, set out in the Treasury Board Policy on Service and Digital, for “approving an annual, forward‑looking 3‑year enterprise‑wide plan that establishes the strategic direction for the integrated management of service, information, data, information technology (IT) and cybersecurity.”&#xD;
&#xD;
Developed by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS), the 2021–2024 DOSP builds on the 2018–2022 one. In line with the GC Digital Standards, TBS designed the plan with users in mind. It incorporates feedback received on previous strategic plans and complements other key policies, guidelines, plans and strategies that set out the requirements for departments’ planning processes (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
The latest DOSP consolidates the 6 strategic themes of the previous one into 4 strategic pillars that support the government’s digital transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
This DOSP recognizes the progress achieved, sets government‑wide priorities and lists key activities for departments and agencies,Footnote1 including those that serve other government organizations by working to modernize service delivery, improve sustainability and promote digital stewardship. These priorities and activities will help departments move toward digital program and service delivery for Canadians. The updated DOSP was developed by the Digital Government team, with support from Public Services and Procurement Canada and the Canada School of Public Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
Departments will develop their own integrated plans that align with the DOSP and that support their departmental mandates and requirements. TBS will update the DOSP annually, to address any emerging priorities and actions, and will prepare an annual progress report.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 2021–2024 DOSP supports Canada’s Digital Government Strategy, led by the GC’s first Minister of Digital Government (see Appendix B for the Minister’s mandate letters). The strategy will help improve service delivery by accelerating the GC’s digital transformation and increasing collaboration with all levels of government. To align efforts across the GC and build a consistent digital experience, the Minister leads the Digital Government team, which includes, TBS (specifically, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Digital Transformation Office and Canadian Digital Service) and Shared Services Canada. &#xD;
&#xD;
*Message from the Chief Information Officer of Canada*&#xD;
I am pleased to release the Digital Operations Strategic Plan (DOSP) for 2021–2024 at this pivotal time for Canada and Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
The COVID‑19 pandemic significantly accelerated the global shift to online services and the trend toward remote work. From the onset of the pandemic, public servants rose to the occasion, working across traditional divides and innovating to rapidly deliver essential services digitally to millions of Canadians, including emergency benefits and the COVID Alert app. Shared Services Canada worked tirelessly with departments and agencies to maintain quick, efficient and secure delivery of critical front‑line services.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Canada’s economy recovers from the pandemic, the need for digital government is more pronounced than ever: a government that is more open and more collaborative and that provides improved digital‑first, user‑centred services and programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
To make digital government a reality in an unpredictable environment, we in the Government of Canada (GC) must modernize how we manage technology and technological change to keep government responsive and resilient so that it meets the changing needs and expectations of Canadians and Canadian businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since the 2018–2022 DOSP, we have introduced important changes to our digital governance, policy suite and management practices to set the foundation for a digital government across all ministries. We are on track to launch the OneGC platform, which will allow individuals and businesses to use a single identity and password to access federal government services through a single window on Canada.ca.&#xD;
&#xD;
Going forward, we need to eliminate long‑standing institutional barriers to digital acceleration, leverage innovative technologies and put users at the heart of all we do, in line with the GC Digital Standards. We must also implement lessons learned from our response to the COVID‑19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 2021–2024 DOSP provides the strategic direction for the GC’s integrated management of service, information, data, IT and cybersecurity. It sets out priorities and actions to accelerate our efforts. Given our shifting operating environment, we will review this document annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our priorities include:&#xD;
&#xD;
making investments so that the GC has easy‑to‑use, reliable, modern and secure IT systems, networks and infrastructure that support whole‑of‑government operations&#xD;
developing and delivering services that, by design, put users first by being accessible, inclusive, secure and easy to use, and that respect privacy and choice of official language&#xD;
improving data-driven decision‑making&#xD;
getting the most value for the public from the data and information the GC holds&#xD;
modernizing funding and procurement approaches to support more agile execution practices&#xD;
acting ethically and in environmentally sustainable ways&#xD;
Our employees remain our most valuable resource. We need to attract and retain top‑notch talent. We will make sure that our multidisciplinary workforce has the right digital skills, that these skills are put to use in the right place, and that employees have modern tools and are supported by enabling leadership. We will also continue to strive to make our workforce inclusive and diverse.&#xD;
&#xD;
The journey to fully digital service delivery requires collaboration, experimentation and continual improvement across the GC. I am humbled and proud to be on this journey with you, working together to make digital service delivery better, faster, greener and more reliable.&#xD;

Additional notes on Strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Adapt Soke and Hub Service Model&#xD;
- centralized SIEM service (SIEM Hub):  subscrib to SSC or do it all in-house&#xD;
- Spokes are data sources feeding to the Hub&#xD;
- SIEM is the central piece linking all SOC tools&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Data Masking (DM) Stragegy&#xD;
Mask sensitive data in logs by:&#xD;
- Use custom code to auto-check the presence of sensitive data every time a message gets logged&#xD;
- leaverage vendor capabilities of masking sensitive data&#xD;
- Leverage data filters in log agent configurations that anonymize sensitive data before the log data is transmittted to log server&#xD;
- Explore investing an Enterprise DM tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Standardize what to log per data source&#xD;
- Leverage GC Event Log Strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
4. Unify and consolidate logs for monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
5. Leverage advance technologies in AI, ML and automation&#xD;
