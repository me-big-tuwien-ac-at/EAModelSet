I can confirm that what you’re experiencing is expected behavior, which I’m happy explain. Once you have more than 11 direct messages (DMs) or group DMs open, any additional direct messages are expected to fall off the list if the DM is not opened during your current session, there has been no activity in the DM in the past week, or there are no unread messages in the DM.","Specialization 1"

- These mentions won't notify people when their notifications are paused, or when they're used in threads.
- In channels with at least six members, Slack will ask you to confirm before you send a message with any of these mentions. Owners and admins can turn this warning off.
- On the Enterprise Grid plan, these mentions work differently in channels. If there are 10,000 members or more, only owners and admins can use @channel and @here.

If a channel or direct message name is bolded in your channel list, that means there are unread messages. You can click the bolded channel or direct message to open the conversation and view unread messages.
