What are Competencies?
Competencies are observable abilities, skills, knowledge, motivations or traits defined in terms of the behaviours needed for successful job performance. Competencies are not new. What is new is their integrated use across human resource functions.

How Are the Competencies Structured?
For all competencies in the dictionary, a definition is provided. Each competency also includes a proficiency scale that indicates the full range of expression of the competency. Most proficiency scales have five levels. Each proficiency level is described in terms of behavioural indicators. The behaviours at each level of the scale are illustrative rather than definitive; that is other examples of behaviour are possible. Each competency scale is cumulative which means that, although behaviours from lower levels are not repeated at higher level, they nonetheless apply.

How to Use this Dictionary?
The contents of this dictionary represent the behavioural or non-technical competencies that apply to jobs in the federal Public Service. The dictionary can be used for a variety of purposes including recruitment and staffing, learning and career development and performance management. For each job, choose the competencies and proficiency levels that are most critical to performance excellence.",""

Introduction
Competencies are observable abilities, skills, knowledge, motivations or traits defined in terms of the behaviours needed for successful job performance. Often competencies reflect very general attributes common to all jobs (e.g., analytical thinking, problem solving, client orientation). However, the goal of the present exercise was to identify technical competencies - competencies required from incumbents occupying various jobs/roles in the IT Community that reflect the unique knowledge and skill set expected from these IT employees – that would complement the Behavioural Competency Dictionary. The resulting Technical Competency Dictionary for the IT Community was developed in partnership with subject matter experts in the IT Community and is the outcome of numerous interviews and discussions with CS representatives in different roles and levels from several large departments.

How Are the Competencies Structured?
For all competencies in the dictionary, a brief definition is provided as well as a list of points of knowledge required. Each competency also includes a proficiency scale that indicates the full range of expression of the competency. Each proficiency scale has five levels indicating the depth and breadth to which knowledge and skill are required in the job. Each proficiency level is described in terms of behavioural indicators. The behaviours at each level of the scale are illustrative rather than definitive; that is, other examples of behaviour are possible and can be used at each level. Each competency scale is cumulative which means that, although behaviours from lower levels are not repeated at higher level, they nonetheless apply.

1. Introductory - Demonstrates introductory understanding and ability and, with guidance, applies the competency in a few simple situations.
2. Basic - Demonstrates basic knowledge and ability and, with guidance, can apply the competency in common situations that present limited difficulties.
3. Intermediate - Demonstrates solid knowledge and ability, and can apply the competency with minimal or no guidance in the full range of typical situations. Would require guidance to handle novel or more complex situations.
4. Advanced - Demonstrates advanced knowledge and ability, and can apply the competency in new or complex situations. Guides other professionals.
5. Expert - Demonstrates expert knowledge and ability, and can apply the competency in the most complex situations. Develops new approaches, methods or policies in the area. Is recognized as an expert, internally and/or externally. Leads the guidance of other professionals.",""
