There are various solutions to get these positions, the best one depending on the information you have access to and the type of material that was implanted. Placing the contacts requires a good understanding of the implantation scheme reported by the neurosurgeon, and some skills in reading MRI scans.</p>",""
"_6xuSA_fNEeqygJczXaaxEQ","BusinessProcess","email_confirm","<p>We have two MRI scans for the patient we are processing: before and after the sEEG implantation. The second one shows artifacts around the contacts of the depth electrodes and can be used to identify their positions. In order to use the volumes simultaneously, we use SPM to register them together, then normalize them to the MNI space.</p>",""
